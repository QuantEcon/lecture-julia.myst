    "capital and hence wages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. invest in capital specific to the current job via $\\phi$\n",
    "1. search for a new job with better job-specific capital match via $s$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since wages are $x (1 - s - \\phi)$, marginal cost of investment via either $\\phi$ or $s$ is identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our risk neutral worker should focus on whatever instrument has the highest expected return.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relative expected return will depend on $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose first that $x = 0.05$\n",
    "\n",
    "* If $s=1$ and $\\phi = 0$, then since $G(x,\\phi) = 0$,\n",
    "  taking expectations of {eq}`jd` gives expected next period capital equal to $\\pi(s) \\mathbb{E} U\n",
    "  = \\mathbb{E} U = 0.5$.\n",
    "* If $s=0$ and $\\phi=1$, then next period capital is $G(x, \\phi) = G(0.05, 1) \\approx 0.23$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both rates of return are good, but the return from search is better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next suppose that $x = 0.4$\n",
    "\n",
    "* If $s=1$ and $\\phi = 0$, then expected next period capital is again $0.5$\n",
    "* If $s=0$ and $\\phi = 1$, then $G(x, \\phi) = G(0.4, 1) \\approx 0.8$\n",
    "\n",
    "Return from investment via $\\phi$ dominates expected return from search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining these observations gives us two informal predictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. At any given state $x$, the two controls $\\phi$ and $s$ will function primarily as substitutes --- worker will focus on whichever instrument has the higher expected return.\n",
    "1. For sufficiently small $x$, search will be preferable to investment in job-specific human capital.  For larger $x$, the reverse will be true.\n",
