    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture we study optimal fiscal policy in a linear quadratic setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "We slightly modify a well-known model of Robert Lucas and Nancy Stokey {cite}`LucasStokey1983` so that convenient formulas for\n",
    "solving linear-quadratic models can be applied to simplify the calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The economy consists of a representative household and a benevolent government.\n",
    "\n",
    "The government finances an exogenous stream of government purchases with state-contingent loans and a linear tax on labor income.\n",
    "\n",
    "A linear tax is sometimes called a flat-rate tax.\n",
    "\n",
    "The household maximizes utility by choosing paths for consumption and labor, taking prices and the government's tax rate and borrowing plans as given.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maximum attainable utility for the household depends on the government's tax and borrowing plans.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *Ramsey problem* {cite}`Ramsey1927` is  to choose tax and borrowing plans that maximize the household's welfare, taking the household's optimizing behavior as given.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a large number of competitive equilibria indexed by different government fiscal policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ramsey planner chooses the best competitive equilibrium.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to study  the dynamics of tax rates,  tax revenues, government debt under a Ramsey plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the Lucas and Stokey model features state-contingent government debt, the government debt dynamics differ substantially from those in a model of Robert Barro {cite}`Barro1979`.\n",

    "## The Ramsey Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by outlining the key assumptions regarding technology, households and the government sector.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technology\n",
    "\n",
    "Labor can be converted one-for-one into a single, non-storable consumption good.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the usual spirit of the LQ model, the amount of labor supplied in each period is unrestricted.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is unrealistic, but helpful when it comes to solving the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Realistic labor supply can be induced by suitable parameter values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Households\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a representative household who chooses a path $\\{\\ell_t, c_t\\}$\n",
    "for labor and consumption to maximize\n",

    "by an appropriate probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The budget constraint {eq}`lq_hc` requires that the present value of consumption be restricted to equal the present value of endowments, labor income and coupon payments on bond holdings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Government\n",
    "\n",
    "The government imposes a linear tax on labor income, fully committing to a stochastic path of tax rates at time zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "The government also issues state-contingent debt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given government tax and borrowing plans, we can construct a competitive equilibrium with distorting government taxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among all such competitive equilibria, the Ramsey plan is the one that maximizes the welfare of the representative consumer.\n",
