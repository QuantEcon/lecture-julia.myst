    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This lecture describes what has come to be called a *lake model*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lake model is a basic tool for modeling unemployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "It allows us to analyze\n",
    "\n",
    "* flows between unemployment and employment\n",
    "* how these flows influence steady state employment and unemployment rates\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a good model for interpreting monthly labor department reports on gross and net jobs created and jobs destroyed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"lakes\" in the model are the pools of employed and unemployed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"flows\" between the lakes are caused by\n",
    "\n",
    "* firing and hiring\n",
    "* entry and exit from the labor force\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first part of this lecture, the parameters governing transitions into\n",
    "and out of unemployment and employment are exogenous.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later, we'll determine some of these transition rates endogenously using the {doc}`McCall search model <../dynamic_programming/mccall_model>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also use some nifty concepts like ergodicity, which provides a fundamental link between *cross-sectional* and *long run time series* distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "These concepts will help us build an equilibrium model of ex ante homogeneous workers whose different luck generates variations in their ex post experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before working through what follows, we recommend you read the {doc}`lecture on finite Markov chains <../introduction_dynamics/finite_markov>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also need some basic {doc}`linear algebra <../tools_and_techniques/linear_algebra>` and probability. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The economy is inhabited by a very large number of ex ante identical workers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The workers live forever, spending their lives moving between unemployment and employment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their rates of  transition between employment and unemployment are  governed by the following parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\lambda$, the job finding rate for currently unemployed workers\n",
    "* $\\alpha$, the dismissal rate for currently employed workers\n",
    "* $b$, the entry rate into the labor force\n",
    "* $d$, the exit rate from the labor force\n",
    "\n",
    "The growth rate of the labor force evidently equals $g=b-d$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aggregate Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to derive the dynamics of the following aggregates\n",
    "\n",
    "* $E_t$, the total number of employed workers at date $t$\n",
    "* $U_t$, the total number of unemployed workers at $t$\n",
    "* $N_t$, the number of workers in the labor force at $t$\n",
    "\n",
    "We also want to know the values of the following objects\n",
    "\n",
    "* The employment rate $e_t := E_t/N_t$.\n",
    "* The unemployment rate $u_t := U_t/N_t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Here and below, capital letters represent stocks and lowercase letters represent flows)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Laws of Motion for Stock Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by constructing laws of motion for the aggregate variables $E_t,U_t, N_t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of the mass of workers $E_t$ who are employed at date $t$,\n",
    "\n",
    "* $(1-d)E_t$ will remain in the labor force\n",
    "* of these, $(1-\\alpha)(1-d)E_t$ will remain employed\n",
    "\n",
    "Of the mass of workers $U_t$ workers who are currently unemployed,\n",
    "\n",
    "* $(1-d)U_t$ will remain in the labor force\n",
    "* of these, $(1-d) \\lambda U_t$ will become employed\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore,  the number of workers who will be employed at date $t+1$ will be\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E_{t+1} = (1-d)(1-\\alpha)E_t + (1-d)\\lambda U_t\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar analysis implies\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "U_{t+1} = (1-d)\\alpha E_t + (1-d)(1-\\lambda)U_t + b (E_t+U_t)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The value $b(E_t+U_t)$ is the mass of new workers entering the labor force unemployed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The total stock of workers $N_t=E_t+U_t$ evolves as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "N_{t+1} = (1+b-d)N_t = (1+g)N_t\n",
    "$$\n",
