    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture we study a simplified version of an uncertainty traps model of Fajgelbaum, Schaal and Taschereau-Dumouchel {cite}`fun`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model features self-reinforcing uncertainty that has big impacts on economic activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the model,\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fundamentals  vary stochastically and are not fully observable.\n",
    "* At any moment there are both active and inactive entrepreneurs; only active entrepreneurs produce.\n",
    "* Agents -- active and inactive entrepreuneurs --  have beliefs about the fundamentals expressed as probability distributions.\n",
    "* Greater uncertainty means greater dispersions of these distributions.\n",
    "* Entrepreneurs are risk averse and hence less inclined to be active  when uncertainty is high.\n",
    "* The output of active entrepreneurs is observable, supplying a noisy signal that helps everyone inside the model infer fundamentals.\n",
    "* Entrepreneurs update their beliefs about fundamentals using Bayes' Law, implemented via {doc}`Kalman filtering <../introduction_dynamics/kalman>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uncertainty traps emerge because:\n",
    "\n",
    "* High uncertainty discourages entrepreneurs from becoming active.\n",
    "* A low level of participation -- i.e., a smaller number of active entrepreneurs -- diminishes the flow of information about fundamentals.\n",
    "* Less information translates to higher uncertainty, further discouraging entrepreneurs from choosing to be active, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uncertainty traps stem from a positive externality: high aggregate economic activity levels generates valuable information.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The original model described in {cite}`fun` has many interesting moving parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we examine a simplified version that nonetheless captures many of the key ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "The evolution of the fundamental process $\\{\\theta_t\\}$ is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\theta_{t+1} = \\rho \\theta_t + \\sigma_{\\theta} w_{t+1}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\sigma_\\theta > 0$ and $0 < \\rho < 1$\n",
    "* $\\{w_t\\}$ is IID and standard normal\n",
    "\n",
    "The random variable $\\theta_t$ is not observable at any time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a total $\\bar M$ of risk averse entrepreneurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output of the $m$-th entrepreneur, conditional on being active in the market at\n",
    "time $t$, is equal to\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the time subscript has been dropped to simplify notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inverse of the shock variance, $\\gamma_x$, is called the shock's **precision**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The higher is the precision, the more informative $x_m$ is about the fundamental.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output shocks are independent across time and firms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Information and Beliefs\n",
    "\n",
    "All entrepreneurs start with identical beliefs about $\\theta_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Signals are publicly observable and hence all agents have identical beliefs always.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dropping time subscripts, beliefs for current $\\theta$ are represented by the normal\n",
    "distribution $N(\\mu, \\gamma^{-1})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $\\gamma$ is the precision of beliefs; its inverse is the degree of uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "These parameters are updated by Kalman filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\mathbb M \\subset \\{1, \\ldots, \\bar M\\}$ denote the set of currently active firms\n",
    "* $M := |\\mathbb M|$ denote the number of currently active firms\n",
    "* $X$ be the average output $\\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{m \\in \\mathbb M} x_m$ of the active firms\n",
    "\n",
    "With this notation and primes for next period values, we can write the updating of the mean and precision via\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: update_mean\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These are standard Kalman filtering results applied to the current setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exercise 1 provides more details on how {eq}`update_mean` and {eq}`update_prec` are derived, and then asks you to fill in remaining steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next figure plots the law of motion for the precision in {eq}`update_prec`\n",
    "as a 45 degree diagram, with one curve for each $M \\in \\{0, \\ldots, 6\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other parameter values are $\\rho = 0.99, \\gamma_x = 0.5, \\sigma_\\theta =0.5$\n",

    "Points where the curves hit the 45 degree lines are  long run steady\n",
    "states for precision for different values of $M$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, if one of these values for $M$ remains fixed, a corresponding steady state is the equilibrium level of precision\n",
    "\n",
    "* high values of $M$ correspond to greater information about the\n",
    "  fundamental, and hence more precision in steady state\n",
    "* low values of $M$ correspond to less information and more uncertainty in steady state\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, as we'll see, the number of active firms fluctuates stochastically.\n",
