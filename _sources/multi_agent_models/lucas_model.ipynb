    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated in an {doc}`earlier lecture <../multi_agent_models/markov_asset>`, an asset is a claim on a stream of prospective payments.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the correct price to pay for such a claim?\n",
    "\n",
    "The elegant asset pricing model of Lucas {cite}`Lucas1978` attempts to answer this question in an equilibrium setting with risk averse agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we mentioned some consequences of Lucas' model {ref}`earlier <mass_pra>`, it is now time to work through the model more carefully, and try to understand where the fundamental asset pricing equation comes from.\n",
    "\n",
    "A side benefit of studying Lucas' model is that it provides a beautiful illustration of model building in general and equilibrium pricing in competitive models in particular.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another difference to our {doc}`first asset pricing lecture <../multi_agent_models/markov_asset>` is that the state space and shock will be continous rather than discrete.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Lucas Model\n",
    "\n",
    "```{index} single: Lucas Model\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Lucas studied a pure exchange economy with a representative consumer (or household), where\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Pure exchange* means that all endowments are exogenous.\n",
    "* *Representative* consumer means that either\n",
    "    * there is a single consumer (sometimes also referred to as a household), or\n",
    "    * all consumers have identical endowments and preferences\n",
    "\n",
    "Either way, the assumption of a representative agent means that prices adjust to eradicate desires to trade.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes it very easy to compute competitive equilibrium prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's review the set up.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assets\n",
    "\n",
    "```{index} single: Lucas Model; Assets\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a single \"productive unit\" that costlessly generates a sequence of consumption goods $\\{y_t\\}_{t=0}^{\\infty}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to view $\\{y_t\\}_{t=0}^{\\infty}$ is as a *consumption endowment* for this economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will assume that this endowment is Markovian, following the exogenous process\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y_{t+1} = G(y_t, \\xi_{t+1})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $\\{ \\xi_t \\}$ is an iid shock sequence with known distribution $\\phi$ and $y_t \\geq 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "An asset is a claim on all or part of this endowment stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "The consumption goods $\\{y_t\\}_{t=0}^{\\infty}$ are nonstorable, so holding assets is the only way to transfer wealth into the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of intuition, it's common to think of the productive unit as a \"tree\" that produces fruit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this idea, a \"Lucas tree\" is a claim on the consumption endowment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Consumers\n",
    "\n",
    "```{index} single: Lucas Model; Consumers\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A representative consumer ranks consumption streams $\\{c_t\\}$ according to the time separable utility functional\n",
    "\n",

    ":label: lt_uf\n",
    "\n",
    "\\mathbb{E} \\sum_{t=0}^\\infty \\beta^t u(c_t)\n",

    "\n",
    "Here\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\beta \\in (0,1)$ is a fixed discount factor\n",
    "* $u$ is a strictly increasing, strictly concave, continuously differentiable period utility function\n",
    "* $\\mathbb{E}$ is a mathematical expectation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pricing a Lucas Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "```{index} single: Lucas Model; Pricing\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What is an appropriate price for a claim on the consumption endowment?\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll price an *ex dividend* claim, meaning that\n",
    "\n",
    "* the seller retains this period's dividend\n",
    "* the buyer pays $p_t$ today to purchase a claim on\n",
    "    * $y_{t+1}$ and\n",
    "    * the right to sell the claim tomorrow at price $p_{t+1}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this is a competitive model, the first step is to pin down consumer\n",
    "behavior, taking prices as given.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we'll impose equilibrium constraints and try to back out prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the consumer problem, the consumer's control variable is the share $\\pi_t$ of the claim held in each period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the consumer problem is to maximize {eq}`lt_uf` subject to\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "c_t + \\pi_{t+1} p_t \\leq \\pi_t y_t + \\pi_t p_t\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "along with $c_t \\geq 0$ and $0 \\leq \\pi_t \\leq 1$ at each $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision to hold share $\\pi_t$ is actually made at time $t-1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this value is inherited as a state variable at time $t$, which explains the choice of subscript.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The dynamic program\n",
    "\n",
    "```{index} single: Lucas Model; Dynamic Program\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can write the consumer problem as a dynamic programming problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first observation is that prices depend on current information, and current information is really just the endowment process up until the current period.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact the endowment process is Markovian, so that the only relevant\n",
    "information is the current state $y \\in \\mathbb R_+$ (dropping the time subscript).\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads us to guess an equilibrium where price is a function $p$ of $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remarks on the solution method\n",
    "\n",
    "* Since this is a competitive (read: price taking) model, the consumer will take this function $p$ as .\n",
    "* In this way we determine consumer behavior given $p$ and then use equilibrium conditions to recover $p$.\n",
    "* This is the standard way to solve competitive equilibrum models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the assumption that price is a given function $p$ of $y$, we write the value function and constraint as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "v(\\pi, y) = \\max_{c, \\pi'}\n",
    "    \\left\\{\n",

    "#### Next steps\n",
    "\n",
    "What we need to do now is determine equilibrium prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "It seems that to obtain these, we will have to\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Solve this two dimensional dynamic programming problem for the optimal policy.\n",
    "1. Impose equilibrium constraints.\n",
    "1. Solve out for the price function $p(y)$ directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as Lucas showed, there is a related but more straightforward way to do this.\n",

    "#### Equilibrium constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "```{index} single: Lucas Model; Equilibrium Constraints\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the consumption good is not storable, in equilibrium we must have $c_t = y_t$ for all $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, since there is one representative consumer (alternatively, since\n",
    "all consumers are identical), there should be no trade in equilibrium.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, the representative consumer owns the whole tree in every period, so $\\pi_t = 1$ for all $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prices must adjust to satisfy these two constraints.\n",

    "u'(c)  p(y) = \\beta \\int v_1'(\\pi', G(y, z)) \\phi(dz)\n",
