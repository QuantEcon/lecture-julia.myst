    "\n",
    "In a {doc}`previous lecture <../introduction_dynamics/finite_markov>` we learned about finite Markov chains, a relatively elementary class of stochastic dynamic models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The present lecture extends this analysis to continuous (i.e., uncountable) state Markov chains.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most stochastic dynamic models studied by economists either fit directly into this class or can be represented as continuous state Markov chains after minor modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, our focus will be on continuous Markov models that\n",
    "\n",
    "* evolve in discrete time\n",
    "* are often nonlinear\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that we accommodate nonlinear models here is significant, because\n",
    "linear stochastic models have their own highly developed tool set, as we'll\n",
    "see {doc}`later on <../time_series_models/arma>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question that interests us most is: Given a particular stochastic dynamic\n",

    "\n",
    "In particular,\n",
    "\n",
    "* What happens to the distribution of the state variables?\n",
    "* Is there anything we can say about the \"average behavior\" of these variables?\n",
    "* Is there a notion of \"steady state\" or \"long run equilibrium\" that's applicable to the model?\n",
    "    * If so, how can we compute it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answering these questions will lead us to revisit many of the topics that occupied us in the finite state case,\n",
    "such as simulation, distribution dynamics, stability, ergodicity, etc.\n",

    "## The Density Case\n",
    "\n",
    "You are probably aware that some distributions can be represented by densities\n",
    "and some cannot.\n",
    "\n",
    "(For example, distributions on the real numbers $\\mathbb R$ that put positive probability\n",
    "on individual points have no density representation)\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to start our analysis by looking at Markov chains where the one step transition probabilities have density representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefit is that the density case offers a very direct parallel to the finite case in terms of notation and intuition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we've built some intuition we'll cover the general case.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definitions and Basic Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "In our {doc}`lecture on finite Markov chains <../introduction_dynamics/finite_markov>`, we studied discrete time Markov chains that evolve on a finite state space $S$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this setting, the dynamics of the model are described by a stochastic matrix --- a nonnegative square matrix $P = P[i, j]$ such that each row $P[i, \\cdot]$ sums to one.\n",

    "* $P$ can be thought of as a family of distributions $P[i, \\cdot]$, one for each $i \\in S$\n",
    "* $P[i, \\cdot]$ is the distribution of $X_{t+1}$ given $X_t = i$\n",
    "\n",
    "(As you probably recall, when using Julia arrays, $P[i, \\cdot]$ is expressed as `P[i,:]`)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll allow $S$ to be a subset of $\\mathbb R$, such as\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\mathbb R$ itself\n",
    "* the positive reals $(0, \\infty)$\n",
    "* a bounded interval $(a, b)$\n",
    "\n",
    "The family of discrete distributions $P[i, \\cdot]$ will be replaced by a family of densities $p(x, \\cdot)$, one for each $x \\in S$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analogous to the finite state case, $p(x, \\cdot)$ is to be understood as the distribution (density) of $X_{t+1}$ given $X_t = x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "More formally, a *stochastic kernel on* $S$ is a function $p \\colon S \\times S \\to \\mathbb R$ with the property that\n",

    "\n",

    "As discussed above, not all distributions can be represented as densities.\n",

    "be familiar with measure theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can, however, construct a fairly general theory using distribution functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example and Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the issues, recall that Hopenhayn and Rogerson {cite}`HopenhaynRogerson1993` study a model of firm dynamics where individual firm productivity follows the exogenous process\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As is, this fits into the density case we treated above.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the authors wanted this process to take values in $[0, 1]$, so they added boundaries at the end points 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to write this is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "X_{t+1} = h(a + \\rho X_t + \\xi_{t+1})\n",
    "\\quad \\text{where} \\quad\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If you think about it, you will see that for any given $x \\in [0, 1]$,\n",
    "the conditional distribution of $X_{t+1}$ given $X_t = x$\n",
    "puts positive probability mass on 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence it cannot be represented as a density.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we can do instead is use cumulative distribution functions (cdfs).\n",
    "\n",
    "To this end, set\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "G(x, y) := \\mathbb P \\{ h(a + \\rho x + \\xi_{t+1}) \\leq y \\}\n",
    "\\qquad (0 \\leq x, y \\leq 1)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This family of cdfs $G(x, \\cdot)$ plays a role analogous to the stochastic kernel in the density case.\n",
    "\n",
    "The distribution dynamics in {eq}`statd_fdd` are then replaced by\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: statd_fddc\n",
    "\n",
    "F_{t+1}(y) = \\int G(x,y) F_t(dx)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $F_t$ and $F_{t+1}$ are cdfs representing the distribution of the current state and next period state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition behind {eq}`statd_fddc` is essentially the same as for {eq}`statd_fdd`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computation\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wish to compute these cdfs, you cannot use the look-ahead estimator as before.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, you should not use any density estimator, since the objects you are\n",
    "estimating/computing are not densities.\n",

    "## Stability\n",
    "\n",
    "In our {doc}`lecture <../introduction_dynamics/finite_markov>` on finite Markov chains we also studied stationarity, stability and ergodicity.\n",

    "Here we will cover the same topics for the continuous case.\n",

    "\n",
    "The general case is relatively similar --- references are given below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theoretical Results\n",
    "\n",
    "Analogous to {ref}`the finite case <mc_stat_dd>`, given a stochastic kernel $p$ and corresponding Markov operator as\n",
    "defined in {eq}`def_dmo`, a density $\\psi^*$ on $S$ is called\n",
    "*stationary* for $P$ if it is a fixed point of the operator $P$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words,\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: statd_dsd\n",
    "\n",
    "\\psi^*(y) = \\int p(x,y) \\psi^*(x) \\, dx,\n",
    "\\qquad \\forall y \\in S\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the finite case, if $\\psi^*$ is stationary for $P$, and\n",
    "the distribution of $X_0$ is $\\psi^*$, then, in view of\n",
    "{eq}`statd_p`, $X_t$ will have this same distribution for all $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence $\\psi^*$ is the stochastic equivalent of a steady state.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the finite case, we learned that at least one stationary distribution exists, although there may be many.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the state space is infinite, the situation is more complicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even existence can fail very easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the random walk model has no stationary density (see, e.g., [EDTC](http://johnstachurski.net/edtc.html), p. 210).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are well-known conditions under which a stationary density $\\psi^*$ exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "With additional conditions, we can also get a unique stationary density ($\\psi \\in \\mathscr D \\text{ and } \\psi = \\psi P \\implies \\psi = \\psi^*$),  and also global convergence in the sense that\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This combination of existence, uniqueness and global convergence in the sense\n",
    "of {eq}`statd_dca` is often referred to as *global stability*.\n",

    "Note that the convergence in {eq}`statd_lln` does not depend on the distribution (or value) of $X_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is actually very important for simulation --- it means we can learn about $\\psi^*$ (i.e., approximate the right hand side of {eq}`statd_lln` via the left hand side) without requiring any special knowledge about what to do with $X_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what are these conditions we require to get global stability and ergodicity?\n",

    "In the preceding figure, each sequence of densities is converging towards the unique stationary density $\\psi^*$.\n",
