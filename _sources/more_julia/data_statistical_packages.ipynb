    "This list is not exhaustive, and others can be found in organizations such as [JuliaStats](https://github.com/JuliaStats), [JuliaData](https://github.com/JuliaData/), and  [QueryVerse](https://github.com/queryverse)."

    "A useful package for working with data is [DataFrames.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/DataFrames.jl).\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important data type provided is a `DataFrame`, a two dimensional array for storing heterogeneous data.\n",

    "Although data can be heterogeneous within a `DataFrame`, the contents of the columns must be homogeneous\n",
    "(of the same type).\n",
