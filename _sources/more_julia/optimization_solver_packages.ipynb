    "programming is the natural evolution of automatic differentiation (AD, sometimes called algorithmic differentiation).\n",

    "    * You can sometimes calculate the derivative on pen-and-paper, and potentially simplify the expression.\n",
    "    * In effect, repeated applications of the chain rule, product rule, etc.\n",
    "    * It is sometimes, though not always, the most accurate and fastest option if there are algebraic simplifications.\n",
    "    * Sometimes symbolic integration on the computer a good solution, if the package can handle your functions. Doing algebra by hand is tedious and error-prone, but\n",
    "      is sometimes invaluable.\n",
    "* Finite differences\n",
    "    * Evaluate the function at least $N+1$ times to get the gradient -- Jacobians are even worse.\n",
    "    * Large $\\Delta$ is numerically stable but inaccurate, too small of $\\Delta$ is numerically unstable but more accurate.\n",
    "    * Choosing the $\\Delta$ is hard, so use packages such as [DiffEqDiffTools.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DiffEqDiffTools.jl).\n",

    "* Automatic Differentiation\n",
    "    * The same as analytic/symbolic differentiation, but where the **chain rule** is calculated **numerically** rather than symbolically.\n",
    "    * Just as with analytic derivatives, can establish rules for the derivatives of individual functions (e.g. $d\\left(sin(x)\\right)$ to $cos(x) dx$) for intrinsic derivatives.\n",
