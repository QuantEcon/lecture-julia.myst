    "    * It is sometimes the most accurate and fastest option if there are algebraic simplifications.\n",
    "    * Sometimes, symbolic computation on the computer is a good solution if the package can handle your functions. Doing algebra by hand is tedious and error-prone, but sometimes invaluable.\n",
    "* Finite differences\n",
    "    * Evaluate the function at least $N+1$ times to get the gradient -- Jacobians are even worse.\n",
    "    * Large $\\Delta$ is numerically stable but inaccurate; too small is numerically unstable but more accurate.\n",
    "    * Choosing the $\\Delta$ is hard, so use packages such as [DiffEqDiffTools.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DiffEqDiffTools.jl).\n",

    "### Reverse-Mode AD\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike forward-mode auto-differentiation, reverse-mode is very difficult to implement efficiently, and many variations on the best approach exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many reverse-mode packages are connected to machine-learning packages, since the efficient gradients of $R^N \\to R$ loss functions are necessary for the gradient descent optimization algorithms used in machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, Julia lacks a single, consistently usable reverse-mode AD package without rough edges. However, a few key options to consider are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ReverseDiff.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/ReverseDiff.jl), a relatively dependable but limited package.  Not really intended for standard ML-pipeline usage or scientific computing.\n",
    "- [Zygote.jl](https://github.com/FluxML/Zygote.jl), which is flexible but buggy and less reliable. It is undergoing deprecation but often remains a common alternative.\n",
    "- [Mooncake.jl](https://github.com/chalk-lab/Mooncake.jl), a promising Julia-native AD package, which might be a cleaner and better maintained alternative to Zygote.jl.\n",
    "- [Enzyme.jl](https://enzyme.mit.edu/julia/stable/), which is the most promising and supports both forward and reverse mode. However, as it operates at a lower compiler level, it cannot support all Julia code. In particular, it favors in-place functions over \"pure\" functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Enzyme\n",
    "\n",
    "[Enzyme.jl](https://enzyme.mit.edu/julia/stable/) is a high-performance automatic differentiation (AD) tool that operates at the LLVM level (compiler IR) rather than the source code level. This allows it to differentiate through low-level optimizations, mutation, and foreign function calls where other AD tools might fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "**Caution** : Enzyme.jl is under active development.  Some of the patterns shown here may change in future releases.  In practice, you may find using an LLM to be very valuable for navigating the perplexing error messages of Enzyme.jl.  Compilation times can be very slow, and performance intuition is not always straightforward.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this power does make usage somewhat more challenging, as you need to ensure the compiler-generated code conforms to certain patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "It supports both **Forward Mode** (best for $N \\to \\text{Many}$ derivatives) and **Reverse Mode** (best for gradients of scalar loss functions, $N \\to 1$), and nested differentiation (e.g., Hessians).\n",
    "\n",
    "While `ForwardDiff.jl` is often easier for simple problems, Enzyme is capable of high-performance differentiation typically used in scientific computing and scientific machine learning (e.g., differentiable simulations and sensitivity analysis of differential equations).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison to the Python Ecosystem\n",
    "\n",
    "Relative to JAX and PyTorch, Enzyme is often faster and more flexible for specialized algorithms in scientific computing (e.g., ODE solvers, physical simulations) because it differentiates at the LLVM level rather than the operation level. However, Enzyme itself is a low-level tool; it lacks the high-level layers for managing neural network state and batching found in PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "One current advantage of Enzyme is that it has traditionally been difficult to write mutating code in JAX, which is essential in many scientific computing applications. The JAX ecosystem has been making progress on this limitation through mechanisms like \"hijax\" support in [JAX NNX](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nnx_basics.html). This mechanism allows users to write standard Python classes with **in-place mutation**, which the library then automatically transforms into JAX-compatible functional code during compilation. However, this remains experimental, whereas Enzyme handles mutation directly.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lux.jl: Neural Networks in Julia\n",
    "\n",
    "While not designed for standard deep learning pipelines out of the box, Enzyme can be paired with frameworks like [Lux.jl](https://github.com/LuxDL/Lux.jl) to handle deep learning tasks and implement neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike Pytorch and the default behavior of JAX's [Flax NNX](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nnx_basics.html), the Lux.jl framework does not use implicit differentiable arguments within the neural network layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, the differentiable parameters are explicitly passed and separated from non-differentiable arguments. This is consistent with the split/merge pattern in [JAX NNX](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/performance.html#functional-training-loop).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reactant.jl: The Bridge to TPUs and XLA\n",
    "A recent addition to this ecosystem is [Reactant.jl](https://github.com/EnzymeAD/Reactant.jl).\n",
    "\n",
    "While Enzyme optimizes code for the CPU (and CUDA via LLVM), Reactant is designed to compile Julia code for high-performance accelerators like TPUs, as well as multi-node GPU clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, Reactant is a compiler frontend that lowers Julia code (and Enzyme gradients) into MLIR (Multi-Level Intermediate Representation) and StableHLO. This targets the exact same compiler stack as JAX. In particular, JAX traces Python code to generate HLO/StableHLO, which is then compiled by XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra). Reactant does the same for Julia and allows it to emit the same IR that JAX generates.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows Julia users to leverage the XLA compiler's massive optimizations for linear algebra and convolution, run natively on Google TPUs, and execute on large-scale distributed clusters, all while writing standard Julia code. However, this is in early stages of development and should not be considered as a general replacement for standard Python ML frameworks and use-cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "See [the Lux.jl documentation](https://github.com/LuxDL/Lux.jl?tab=readme-ov-file#reactant--enzyme) for an example combining Lux, Reactant, and Enzyme for a single Neural Network.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Writing Enzyme-Differentiable Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Enzyme-friendly code looks like ordinary Julia with a few discipline rules: mutate into preallocated buffers, avoid hidden allocations, and keep inputs type-stable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, these practices also lead to very high-performance Julia code, so making code Enzyme-differentiable and high-performance often go hand-in-hand. However, these tend to be more advanced patterns than an introductory Julia user might be used to.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common pattern is `f!(out, inputs..., cache)` where `cache` holds temporary work arrays passed last.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases the biggest change is to use in-place linear algebra, many of which have corresponding highly optimized BLAS/LAPACK routines. For example:\n",
    "- `mul!(y, A, x)` implements the out-of-place math `y = A * x` without allocating\n",
    "- Use the 5-arg form `mul!(Y, A, B, α, β)` to compute `Y = α * A * B + β * Y` in-place (see [mul! docs](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/LinearAlgebra/#LinearAlgebra.mul!))\n",
    "- Use `ldiv!(y, A, x)` for the in-place solve corresponding to `y = A \\ x` (see [ldiv! docs](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/LinearAlgebra/#LinearAlgebra.ldiv!))\n",
    "- Use column-wise access or `@views` when slicing to avoid copies\n",
    "- Pass buffers explicitly to keep the function allocation-free; even a simple `cache = (; tmp = similar(x))` helps for temporary workspaces.\n",
    "- When in doubt, use a loop.  Since it operates on compiled Julia code, Enzyme can differentiate through loops efficiently."

    "* **Shadow:** The separate memory location where derivatives are accumulated (e.g., `dx` or `db`).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fundamental Rules of Activity\n",
    "When calling `autodiff`, every argument needs an \"Activity\" wrapper to tell Enzyme how to handle it.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Are you differentiating with respect to this argument?**\n",
    "    * **No:** Use `Const(x)`. This tells Enzyme the value is constant and its derivative is zero.\n",
    "    * **Yes (Scalar):** Use `Active(x)`. Enzyme will return the derivative directly.\n",
    "    * **Yes (Array/Struct):** Use `Duplicated(x, dx)`. You must provide the shadow memory `dx`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Is the argument mutated (written to) inside the function?**\n",
    "    * **Yes, and I need to know the value:** Use `Duplicated(x, dx)`. Enzyme needs the shadow `dx` to store intermediate adjoints during the reverse pass.\n",
    "    * **Yes, and I do not need to access the value:** You could still use `Duplicated(x, dx)` or `DuplicatedNoNeed(x, dx)` which may avoid some calculations required to calculate `x` if you are not using it directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This last point is important. As your functions are non-allocating, you need to ensure there is a \"shadow\" for any arguments that are used, even if they are just temporary buffers.\n",
