    "\n",
    "This is a sequel to the earlier lecture {doc}`Classical Control with Linear Algebra <../time_series_models/classical_filtering>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "That lecture used linear algebra -- in particular,  the [LU decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LU_decomposition)  -- to formulate and solve a class of linear-quadratic optimal control problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we'll be using a closely related decomposition, the [Cholesky decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesky_decomposition) , to solve linear prediction and filtering problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "We exploit the useful fact that there is an intimate connection between two superficially different classes of problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "* deterministic linear-quadratic (LQ) optimal control problems\n",
    "* linear least squares prediction and filtering problems\n",
    "\n",
    "The first class of problems involves no randomness, while the second is all about randomness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless,  essentially the same mathematics  solves both type of problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "This connection, which is often termed \"duality,\" is present whether one uses \"classical\" or \"recursive\" solution procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact we saw duality at work earlier when we formulated control and prediction problems recursively in lectures {doc}`LQ dynamic programming problems <../dynamic_programming/lqcontrol>`, {doc}`A first look at the Kalman filter <../introduction_dynamics/kalman>`, and {doc}`The permanent income model <../dynamic_programming/perm_income>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A useful consequence of duality is that\n",
    "\n",
    "* With every LQ control problem there is implicitly affiliated a linear least squares prediction or filtering problem.\n",
    "* With every linear least squares prediction or filtering problem there is implicitly affiliated a LQ control problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "An understanding of these connections has repeatedly proved useful in cracking interesting applied problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, Sargent {cite}`Sargent1987` [chs. IX, XIV] and Hansen and Sargent {cite}`HanSar1980` formulated and solved control and filtering problems using $z$-transform methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture we investigate these ideas using mostly elementary linear algebra.\n",
