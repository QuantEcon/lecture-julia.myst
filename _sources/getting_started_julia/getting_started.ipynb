    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture we will cover how to get up and running with Julia.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are alternative ways to access Julia (e.g. if you have a JupyterHub provided by your university), this section assumes you will install it to your {ref}`local desktop  <jl_jupyterlocal>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not strictly required for running the lectures, but we will strongly encourage installing and using [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use it as our primary editor starting in the {doc}`tools lecture <../software_engineering/tools_editors>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## TL;DR\n",
    "Julia and the lecture notebooks can be installed without Jupyter or Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/install/)\n",
    "2. Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)\n",
    "3. Install Julia following the [Juliaup instructions](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup#installation)\n",
    "   - Windows: `winget install julia -s msstore` in a terminal\n",
    "   - Linux/Mac: `curl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh` in a terminal\n",
    "4. Install the [VS Code Julia extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=julialang.language-julia)\n",
    "5. In VS Code, open the command palette with `<Ctrl+Shift+P>` and type `> Git: Clone` to clone the repository `https://github.com/quantecon/lecture-julia.notebooks` in a new window\n",
    "6. Start a Julia REPL in the integrated terminal with `> Julia: Start REPL` from the command palette, then enter package mode with `]` and then type `instantiate`.\n",
    "  - That process will take several minutes to download and compile all of the packages used in the lectures.\n",
    "7. Open any of the `.ipynb` files in VS Code and select the `Julia` channel (i.e., not the Jupyter channels if you have them installed) when prompted to run the notebooks directly within VS Code\n",
    "\n",
    "At that point, you can directly move to the {doc}`julia by example <../getting_started_julia/julia_by_example>` lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Note on Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "[Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks are an alternative way to work with Julia, letting you mix code, formatted text, and output in a single document.  However, the recommended workflow for these lectures is VS Code (see {ref}`Setting up Git and VS Code <initial_vscode_setup>`).  If you prefer standalone Jupyter Lab, see the [installation instructions below](jl_jupyterlocal).\n",
    "\n",
    "These lectures assume some prior programming experience (variables, loops, conditionals). The [Julia documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/) is a good starting point for newcomers.\n",

    "## Desktop Installation of Julia and Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "This section is **only needed if you want the standalone Jupyter Lab workflow**.  If you plan to use VS Code (recommended) or Google Colab, you can skip to {ref}`Setting up Git and VS Code <initial_vscode_setup>`.\n",

    "(install_jupyter)=\n",
    "### Installing Jupyter\n",
    "[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) provides an easy way to install Jupyter, Python, and many data science tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download the binary (<https://www.anaconda.com/download/>) and follow the [installation instructions](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) for your platform.\n",
    "2. If given the option, let Conda add Python to your PATH environment variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "There is direct support for [Jupyter notebooks in VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) with **no Python installation**. See {ref}`VS Code Julia Kernel <running_vscode_kernel>`.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(intro_repl)=\n",
    "### Install Julia\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "The \"official\" installation for Julia is now [Juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup), which makes it easier to upgrade and manage concurrent Julia versions.  See [here](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup#using-juliaup) for a list of commands, such as `juliaup update` to upgrade to the latest available Julia version.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Troubleshooting:** On Mac/Linux, if you have permissions issues on the installation use `sudo curl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh`.  If there are still permissions issues, [see here](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup/wiki/Permission-problems-during-setup) for further steps.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download and install Julia following the [Juliaup instructions](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup#installation)\n",
    "    - Windows: `winget install julia -s msstore` in a terminal\n",
    "    - Linux/Mac: `curl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh` in a terminal\n",
    "    - If you have previously installed Julia manually, you will need to uninstall previous versions before switching to `juliaup`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Open Julia, by either\n",
    "    - Navigating to Julia through your menus or desktop icons (Windows, Mac), or\n",
    "    - Opening a terminal and typing `julia`\n",
    "\n",
    "   You should now be looking at something like this\n",

    "   :width: 100%\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This is called the JULIA *REPL* (Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop), which we discuss more {ref}`later <repl_main>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In the Julia REPL, hit `]` to enter package mode and then enter:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```{code-block} julia\n",
    "   add IJulia\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This adds the `IJulia` kernel which links Julia to Jupyter (i.e., allows your browser to run Julia code, manage Julia packages, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Exit the package mode with backspace and then quit with `exit()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "As entering package mode is common in these notes, we will denote this with `] add IJulia`, etc.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(initial_vscode_setup)=\n",
    "## Setting up Git and VS Code\n",
    "\n",
    "First, install [Git](more_on_git), the industry standard version-control tool, which lets you download files and their entire version history from a server (e.g. on GitHub) to your desktop.  We cover Git in detail in the lectures on {doc}`source code control <../software_engineering/version_control>` and {doc}`testing <../software_engineering/testing>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/install/) and accept the default arguments.\n",
    "   - If you allow Git to add to your path, then you can run it with the `git` command, but we will frequently use the built-in VS Code features.\n",
    "3. (Optional) Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for your platform and open it\n",
    "   - On Windows, during install under `Select Additional Tasks`, choose all options that begin with `Add \"Open with Code\" action`. This lets you open VS Code from inside File Explorer folders directly.\n",
    "   - While optional, we find the experience with VS Code will be much easier and the transition to more advanced tools will be more seamless.\n",
    "4. (Optional) Install the [VS Code Julia](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=julialang.language-julia) extension\n",
    "   - After installation of VS Code, you should be able to choose `Install` on the webpage of any extensions and it will open on your desktop.\n",
    "   - Otherwise: run VS Code and open the extensions with `<Ctrl+Shift+X>` or selecting extensions in the left-hand side of the VS Code window.  Then search for `Julia` in the Marketplace.\n",
    "   ```{figure} /_static/figures/vscode_intro_0.png\n",
    "   :width: 60%\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - No further configuration should be required, but see [here](install_vscode) if you have issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "The VS Code and the VS Code Julia extension will help us better manage environments during our initial setup, and will provide a seamless transition to the more {doc}`advanced tools <../software_engineering/tools_editors>`.\n",

    "(command_palette)=\n",
    "### Command Palette on VS Code\n",
    "\n",
    "A key feature within VS Code is the [Command Palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette), which can be accessed with `<Ctrl+Shift+P>` or `View > Command Palette...` in the menus.\n",

    "2. For the Repository URL, enter `https://github.com/quantecon/lecture-julia.notebooks`\n",
    "3. Choose the location to clone when prompted\n",
    "   - For example, on Windows a good choice is `c:\\Users\\YOURUSERNAME\\Documents\\GitHub`.  On Linux and macOS, `~` or `~/GitHub`.\n",
