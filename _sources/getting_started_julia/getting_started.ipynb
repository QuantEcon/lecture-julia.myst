    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture we will cover how to get up and running with Julia.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are alternative ways to access Julia (e.g. if you have a JupyterHub provided by your university), this section assumes you will install it to your {ref}`local desktop  <jl_jupyterlocal>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not strictly required for running the lectures, but we will strongly encourage installing and using [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "As the most popular and best-supported open-source code editor, it provides a large number of useful features and extensions.  We will begin to use it as a primary editor in the {doc}`tools lecture <../software_engineering/tools_editors>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Note on Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "Like Python and R, and unlike products such as Matlab and Stata, there is a looser connection between Julia as a programming language and Julia as a specific development environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "While you will eventually use other editors, there are some advantages to starting with the [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) environment while learning Julia.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The ability to mix formatted text (including mathematical expressions) and code in a single document.\n",
    "* Nicely formatted output including tables, figures, animation, video, etc.\n",
    "* Conversion tools to generate PDF slides, static HTML, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll discuss the workflow on these features in the [next section](julia_environment)\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Quick installation for experienced users\n",
    "If you have already installed Jupyter, Julia, and Git and have experience with these tools, you can \n",
    "  - Get the notebooks' repositories with `git clone https://github.com/quantecon/lecture-julia.notebooks` \n",
    "  - Open a Jupyter notebook within the downloaded notebooks\n",
    "  - Install the necessary packages in a Julia REPL with `using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()`\n",
    "\n",
    "At that point, you could directly move on to the {doc}`julia by example <../getting_started_julia/julia_by_example>` lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as we strongly recommend becoming familiar with VS Code as a transition towards using more advanced tools and to support better software engineering workflows, so consider walking through the rest of these instructions.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For those with little to no programming experience (e.g. you have never used a loop or \"if\" statement) see the list of [introductory resources](intro_resources).\n",

    "## Desktop Installation of Julia and Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will describe the installation of Julia and Jupyter on your desktop.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```{tip}\n",
    "On Windows, you probably want to install the new open-source [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal).  See [here](https://aka.ms/terminal) for installation instructions, and select the option to add the explorer context menu if provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "It provides a much more modern terminal with better font support for Julia, and with better operating system integration.  For example, you can right-click on a folder in the File Explorer and choose `Open in Microsoft Terminal` to start a terminal in that location.  Rather than providing a particular shell directly, it hosts those that are available in your setup (e.g., PowerShell, Git Bash, Ubuntu Bash in WSL).\n",

    "\n",
    "(install_jupyter)=\n",
    "### Installing Jupyter\n",
    "[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) provides an easy to install package of jupyter, python, and many data science tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have not previously installed Conda or Jupyter, then \n",
    "1. Download the binary (<https://www.anaconda.com/download/>) and follow the [installation instructions](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) for your platform.\n",
    "2. If given the option for your operating system, let Conda add Python to your PATH environment variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "While Conda is the easiest way to install jupyter, it is not strictly required.  With any python you can install with `pip install jupyter`.  Alternatively you can let `IJulia` install its own version of Conda by following [these instructions](https://julialang.github.io/IJulia.jl/dev/manual/running/), or use the direct support for [Jupyter notebooks in VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) - which does no Python installation at all.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(intro_repl)=\n",
    "### Install Julia\n",
    "After Conda is installed, you can install Julia.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "The semi-official installation method for Windows is to use [Juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup), which makes it easier to upgrade and manage concurrent Julia versions.  Support on Mac and Linux is prerelease.  See [here](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup#using-juliaup) for a list of commands, such as `juliaup update` to upgrade to the latest available Julia version after installation, or ways to switch to newer Julia versions after they are released.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download and install Julia following the [Juliaup instructions](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup#installation) or manually installing from [download page](http://julialang.org/downloads/), accepting all default options.  That is,\n",
    "    - Easiest method may be executing `winget install julia -s msstore` in a Windows terminal, or\n",
    "    - `curl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh` on a Mac terminal.\n",
    "    - We recommend installing [manually](https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/#linux_and_freebsd) on Linux.\n",
    "    - If you have previously installed Julia manually, you will need to uninstall previous versions before switching to Juliaup.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Open Julia, by either\n",
    "    - Navigating to Julia through your menus or desktop icons (Windows, Mac), or\n",
    "    - Opening a terminal and type `julia` (Windows; to set this up on macOS, see [here](https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/#macos); to set this up on Linux, see [here](https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/#linux_and_freebsd)).\n",

    "   \n",
    "   This is called the JULIA *REPL* (Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop), which we discuss more {ref}`later <repl_main>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In the Julia REPL, hit `]` to enter package mode and then enter:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```{code-block} julia\n",
    "   add IJulia\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This adds packages for the `IJulia` kernel which links Julia to Jupyter you previously installed with Anaconda (i.e., allows your browser to run Julia code, manage Julia packages, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. You can exit the julia REPL by hitting backspace to exit the package mode, and then \n",
    "\n",
    "   ```{code-block} julia\n",
    "   exit()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "As entering of the package mode is so common in these notes, we will denote this with a `] IJulia`, etc.  On Windows and in Jupyter, you can directly copy this into your terminal, whereas on Linux and macOS you may need to manually enter the package mode.\n",

    "(initial_vscode_setup)=\n",
    "## Setting up Git and VS Code\n",
    "\n",
    "A primary benefit of using [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) languages such as Julia, Python, and R is that they can enable far better workflows for both collaboration and [reproducible research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility#Reproducible_research).\n",
    "\n",
    "Reproducibility will ensure that you, your future self, your collaborators, and eventually the public will be able to run the exact code with the identical environment with which you provided the results - or even roll back to a snapshot in the past where the results may have been different in order to compare.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explore these topics in detail in the lectures on {doc}`source code control <../software_engineering/version_control>` and {doc}`continuous integration and test-driven development <../software_engineering/testing>`, but it is worth installing and beginning to use these tools immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will install [Git](more_on_git), which has become the industry standard open-source version-control tool.  This lets you download both the files and the entire version history from a server (e.g. on GitHub) to your desktop.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git/) and accept the default arguments.\n",
    "   - If you allow Git to add to your path, then you can run it with the `git` command, but we will frequently use the built-in VS Code features.\n",
    "3. (Optional) Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for your platform and open it\n",
    "   - On Windows, during install under `Select Additional Tasks`, choose all options that begin with `Add \"Open with Code\" action`. This lets you open VS Code from inside File Explorer folders directly.\n",
    "   - While optional, we find the experience with VS Code will be much easier and the transition to more advanced tools will be more seamless.\n",
    "4. (Optional) Install the [VS Code Julia](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=julialang.language-julia) extension\n",
    "   - After installation of VS Code, you should be able to choose `Install` on the webpage of any extensions and it will open on your desktop.\n",
    "   - Otherwise: run VS Code and open the extensions with `<Ctrl+Shift+X>` or selecting extensions in the left-hand side of the VS Code window.  Then search for `Julia` in the Marketplace.\n",
    "   ```{figure} /_static/figures/vscode_intro_0.png\n",
    "   :width: 60%\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - No further configuration should be required, but see [here](install_vscode) if you have issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "The VS Code and the VS Code Julia extension will help us better manage environments during our initial setup, and will provide a seamless transition to the more {doc}`advanced tools <../software_engineering/tools_editors>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "(command_palette)=\n",
    "### Command Palette on VS Code\n",
    "\n",
    "A key feature within VS Code is the [Command Palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette), which can be accessed with `<Ctrl+Shift+P>` or `View > Command Palette...` in the menus.\n",
    "\n",

    "denote opening the command palette and searching for a command with things like `> Julia: Start REPL` , etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{tip}\n",
    "You can type partial strings for different commands and it helps you to find features of vscode and its extensions.  Furthermore, the command palette remembers your most recent and common commands.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[Integrated Terminals](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal) within VS Code are a convenient because they are local to that project, detect hypertext links, and provide better fonts.\n",
    "\n",
    "To launch a terminal, use either (1) ``<Ctrl+`>``, (2) `>View: Toggle Terminal` with the command palette, or (3) `View > Terminal` in the menus.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Becoming comfortable with VS Code and tools for source code control/software engineering is an essential step towards ensuring reproducibility.  An easy way to begin that process is to start using VS Code to edit LaTeX, and practice managing your `.tex` files in GitHub rather than dropbox or similar alternatives.  While not directly connected to Julia, this familiarity will make everything easier - even for proprietary languages such as Stata and Matlab.  See [here](vscode_latex) for instructions on this setup process.\n",

    "\n",
    "While the lecture notes can be cloned within VS Code directly, we will use the command-line to begin the introduction to source control tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose and create if necessary a convenient parent folder where you would like the notebooks directory\n",
    "   - The workflow will be easiest if you clone the repo to the default location relative to the home folder for your user.\n",
    "   - For example, on Windows a good choice might be `c:\\Users\\YOURUSERNAME\\Documents\\GitHub` or simply `c:\\Users\\YOURUSERNAME\\Documents`.  On linux and macOS, your home directory `~` or `~/GitHub`.\n",
    "2. Open a new terminal for your machine and navigate to the parent folder of where you wish to store the notebooks.\n",
    "   - On Windows: if using the [Windows Terminal](https://aka.ms/terminal) you can simply right-click on the directory in the File Explorer and choose to \"Open in Microsoft Terminal\" or, alternatively \"Git Bash Here\" to use the terminal provided by Git.

Assuming that you are in the correct location, if you type `activate .` in the package mode, the cursor should change to `(quantecon-notebooks-julia) pkg>` as it activates this project file.\n",
    "\n",
    "One benefit of using the integrated REPL is that it will set important options for launching Julia (e.g. the number of threads) and activate the local project files (i.e. the `Project.toml` file in the notebooks directory) automatically.  If you use an external REPL, you will need to set these manually.  Here you would want to run the REPL with `julia --project --threads auto`  to tell Julia to set the number of threads equal to your local machine's number of cores, and to activate the existing project.

    "The next thing to understand about the Jupyter notebook is that it uses a *modal* editing system.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the effect of typing at the keyboard **depends on which mode you are in**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two modes are\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Edit mode\n",
    "    * Indicated by a blue border around one cell, as in the pictures above.\n",
    "    * Whatever you type appears as is in that cell.\n",
    "1. Command mode\n",
    "    * The blue border disappears and turns into a plain grey border.\n",
    "    * Key strokes are interpreted as commands --- for example, typing b adds a new cell below  the current one.\n",
    "\n",
    "(To learn about other commands available in command mode, go to \"Keyboard Shortcuts\" in the \"Help\" menu)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Switching modes\n",
    "\n",
    "* To switch to command mode from edit mode, hit the `Esc` key.\n",
    "* To switch to edit mode from command mode, hit `Enter` or click in a cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The modal behavior of the Jupyter notebook is a little tricky at first but very efficient when you get used to it.\n",
