    "Our approach is aimed at those who already have at least some knowledge of programming --- perhaps experience with Python, MATLAB, Fortran, C or similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, we assume you have some familiarity with fundamental programming concepts such as\n",
    "\n",
    "* variables\n",
    "* arrays or vectors\n",

    "### (Optional) Resources for Introductory Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "If Julia is your first programming language, then you may want to examine other resources before proceeding through these chapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you will want to ensure that you have [installed Conda](install_jupyter), [Julia](intro_repl) in the previous section, and are able to [launch Jupyter Lab](running_jupyterlab).  Then, even without downloading these lecture notes you can start learning Julia.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some resources for users with little to no programming experience are the:\n",
    "1. [Introduction to Julia](https://juliaacademy.com/p/intro-to-julia) which is appropriate for those with little programming experience.\n",
    "   - You will need to sign up for this course to access it, but it is free.\n",
    "   - Avoid the initial lecture on the installation of Julia and nteract.\n",
    "   - The Jupyter Notebooks for this class are available [online](https://github.com/JuliaAcademy/Introduction-to-Julia)\n",
    "2. [Julia for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhQ2JMBcfAsi_3g2AFJ6B84d8c5jw5kXp) from the [julia for talented amateurs](https://www.youtube.com/c/juliafortalentedamateurs) channel.\n",
    "   - If you watch these, ignore the environment.  It is using a different open-source editor (i.e. Atom, which is being slowly phased out) and the REPL.  However the content itself is independent of the environment. Skip any setup instructions and just use Jupyter.\n",
    "3. [Julia Programming for Nervous Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP8iPy9hna6Qpx0MgGyElJ5qFlaIXYf1R) youtube tutorials.\n",
    "   - These get advanced fairly quickly, but have plenty of great content.\n",
    "   - This may be less gentle of an introduction for new users given the tooling choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you have even introductory experience with any programming language (e.g. you do not need to review what a loop, array, variable, or conditional \"if\" statement is), you should be able to start directly with these lectures.\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture we will write and then pick apart small Julia programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage the objective is to introduce you to basic syntax and data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deeper concepts---how things work---will be covered in later lectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are looking for simplicity the examples are a little contrived\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we will often start with a direct MATLAB/FORTRAN approach which often is **poor coding style** in Julia, but then move towards more **elegant code** which is tightly connected to the mathematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that you've worked your way through {doc}`our getting started lecture <../getting_started_julia/getting_started>` already.\n",
    "\n",
    "The definitive reference is [Julia's own documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/).  The manual is thoughtfully written but is also quite dense.\n",
    "\n",
    "The presentation in this and our remaining lectures is more of a tutorial style based around examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: Plotting a White Noise Process\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, let's suppose that we want to simulate and plot the white noise\n",
    "process $\\epsilon_0, \\epsilon_1, \\ldots, \\epsilon_T$, where each draw $\\epsilon_t$ is independent standard normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction to Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming that you followed  {doc}`our getting started lecture <../getting_started_julia/getting_started>` you will have installed all packages required for your notebooks to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, there are two ways to install packages and versions (where the first method is discouraged, since Julia provides a state-of-the-art setup for reproducible environments)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `add` the packages directly into your global installation (e.g. `Pkg.add(\"MyPackage\")` or `] add MyPackage`) without any project activated.\n",
    "   - We [installed](intro_repl) the `IJulia` package in this way, since it must be accessible in every project.\n",
    "   - As a reminder, the `]` enters the package mode, and with some terminals you can directly copy in the whole `] add MyPackage` string.\n",
    "2. using a directory with a `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` files, which provides an isolated set of packages for a particular project.\n",
    "   - If you load a jupyter notebook, it will automatically look up the tree for the project files to activate, but will not automatically install them.  This can be done with `] instantiate`, as we did in our [installation](install_packages)\n",
    "   - The project files can be in parent folders relative to the notebooks and sourcecode.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The project provides the environment for running code is **reproducible**, so that anyone can replicate the precise set of package and versions used in construction.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the installation and activation, `using` provides a way to say that a particular code or notebook will use the package."
