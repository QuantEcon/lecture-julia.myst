    "This lecture discusses structuring a project as a Julia module, and testing it with tools from GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Specifying dependencies (and their versions) so that your project works across Julia setups and over time.\n",
    "* Being able to load your project's functions from outside without copy/pasting.\n",
    "* Writing tests that run locally, *and automatically on the GitHub server*.\n",
    "* Having GitHub test your project across operating systems, Julia versions, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Throughout this lecture, important points and sequential workflow steps are listed as bullets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this style of coding is to ensure that [test driven development](test_driven) is possible, which will help ensure that your research is reproducible by yourself, your future self, and others - while avoiding accidental mistakes that can silently break old code and change results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, it makes collaboration on code much more feasible - allowing individuals to work on different parts of the code without fear of breaking others' work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, since many economics projects occur over multiple years - this will help your future self to reproduce your results and make changes without remembering all of the subtle tricks required to get things operational.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction and Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of the software engineering and continuous integration (CI) will be done through [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).\n",
    "\n",
    "The GitHub actions execute as isolated and fully reproducible environments on the cloud (using containers), and are initiated through various actions on the GitHub repo.  In particular, these are typically initiated through:\n",
    "- Making commits on the main branch of a repository.\n",
    "- Creating a PR on a repository, or pushing commits to it.\n",
    "- [Tagging a release](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository) of a repository, which provides a snapshot at a particular commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "For publicly available repositories, GitHub provides free minutes for executing these actions, whereas there are limits on the execution time for private repositories - though signing up for the GitHub academic plans previously discussed (i.e, the [Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack/) or [Academic/Researcher plans](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-education-for-educators-and-researchers/)) provides additional free minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "While you may think of a ''Package'' as a shared and maintained set of reusable code, with Julia it will turn out to be the most useful way to organize personal and private projects or the code associated with a particular paper.  The primary benefit of using a package workflow is **reproducibility** for yourself, your future self, and collaborators.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you will find the testing workflow as an essential element of working on even individual projects, since it will prevent you from making accidental breaking changes at points in the future - or when you come back to the code after several years.\n",
    "\n",

    "### GitHub and Codecov Account Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "This lecture assumes you have completed the setup of VS Code and Git in the  {doc}`version control <../software_engineering/version_control>` and  {doc}`tools <../software_engineering/tools_editors>`  lectures.  In particular,\n",
    "- Ensure you have setup a GitHub account, and connected it to VS Code.\n",
    "- Installed and setup VS Code's Julia extension.\n",
    "- Ensure you have completed the `git` configuration steps in your terminal\n",

    "### PkgTemplates.jl and Revise.jl\n",
    "\n",
    "While you can create your Julia package manually, using a template will ensure that you have everything in the standard format.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have activated the notebook repositories, then `PkgTemplates.jl` will already be installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, start a `julia` REPL outside of a particular project (or do an `] activate` to deactivate the existing project, and use the global environment) and\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "While we typically insist on having very few packages in the global environment, and always working with a `Project.toml` file, `PkgTemplates` needs to be used in the global environment as it will create those files.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the [Revise.jl](https://github.com/timholy/Revise.jl) package is optional, it is strongly encouraged since it automatically compiling functions in your package as they are changed.  See [below](editing_package_code) for more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, [JuliaFormatter.jl](https://github.com/domluna/JuliaFormatter.jl) is optional, but recommended to maintain consistent code style.\n",

    ":width: 100%\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, ensure that \n",
    "\n",
    "* The repo you create should have the same name as the project we added (except with a `.jl` extension).\n",
    "* We should leave the boxes unchecked for the `README.md`, `LICENSE`, and `.gitignore`, since these are handled by `PkgTemplates`.\n",
    "* Select the \"Choose GiHub Apps\" and give access to Codecov if available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we can now publish the generated package in VS Code to this empty repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose the icon to publish the branch as we did in previous lectures\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} /_static/figures/new_package_vscode_3.png\n",
    ":width: 100%\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Refresh the webpage on GitHub, and you should see the files appear in the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "At which point, if you refresh the webpage, it should be filled with the generated files\n",
    "```{figure} /_static/figures/new_package_vscode_4.png\n",
    ":width: 100%\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, you will see a badge either saying `CI | passing` or `CI | unknown` next to another for `codecov | unknown`.\n",
    "\n",
    "These badges provide a summary of the current state of the `main` branch relative to the GitHub Actions, as we will see below.  If a repository has broken any tests on the main branch, it will show `CI | failed` in red.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you may notice some Pull Requests have already been created, depending on the versions.  These come from GitHub Actions such as `CompatHelper` which automatically check for updates to dependencies.  For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} /_static/figures/new_package_vscode_4_2.png\n",
    ":width: 100%\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you see those, you typically can open them and immediately choose to \"Merge Pull Request\".\n",
    "\n",
    "After merging, you will need to update your local repository to pull the changes.  For example, VS Code may now show there are changes\n",

    "\n",
    "If so, \"Sync Changes\" to update your local git repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "As always in Julia, it is best to avoid any packages other than `IJulia, Revise, PkgTemplates, JuliaFormatter`, etc. in your global environment. Everything project specific should be added to the `Project.toml` file of a particular project to ensure maximum reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this, we advise not to use `] dev .` to add your local package to the global environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming you had a local installation of a different package in a parallel directory to this, with its own `Project.toml` file, you can point it at the local copy of `MyProject` with first activating the new one, and then `] dev ../MyProject`\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's unpack the structure of the generated project\n",
    "\n",
    "* A hidden directory, `.git`, holds the version control information.\n",
    "* The `src` directory contains the project's source code -- it should contain only one file (`MyProject.jl`), which reads\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```{code-block} julia\n",
    "  module MyProject\n",
    "\n",
    "  # Write your package code here.\n",
    "\n",
    "  end\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  \n",
    "* Likewise, the `test` directory should have only one file (`runtests.jl`), which reads\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```{code-block} julia\n",
    "  using MyProject\n",
    "  using Test\n",
    "\n",
    "  @testset \"MyProject.jl\" begin\n",
    "      # Write your tests here.\n",
    "  end\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, the workflow is to export objects we want to test (`using MyProject`), and test them using Julia's `Test` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other important text files for now are\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml`, which contain dependency information.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, the `Project.toml` contains a list of dependencies, and the `Manifest.toml` specifies their exact versions and sub-dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The `.gitignore` file (which may display as an untitled file), which contains files and paths for `git` to ignore.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GitHub Actions and CI\n",
    "\n",
    "The final file is a GitHub Actions file in the `.github/workflows` folder, called `CI.yml` with the text similar to the following (though it may change over time as new versions of the actions are released):\n",

    "For Julia, the primary choice is [JuliaFormatter.jl](https://github.com/juliautils/JuliaFormatter.jl) which you would have installed in the global environment above with `] add JuliaFormatter`.  Ensure this is at the global rather than project level since it is a tool run by VS Code rather than within the project itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the generated package above, you will see a `.JuliaFormatter.toml` file which contains only a line to use `style = \"sciml\"`.  See [here](https://domluna.github.io/JuliaFormatter.jl/stable/config/) for more information on configuration options.\n",

    "To use the formatter in VS Code with the Julia Extension, open up the `src/MyProject.jl` file, and then use the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) to select `Format Document`.  Choose `Julia (default)` as in\n",

    "* several `@test` for the root of a known function, given the `f` and analytical `f'` derivatives\n",
    "* tests of those roots using the automatic differentiation version of the function\n",

    "* a test to ensure that `tol` is working\n",
    "\n",
    "And anything else you can think of.  You should be able to run `] test` for the project to check that the test-suite is running, and then ensure that it is running automatically on GitHub Actions CI.\n",
