    "To install VS Code and the Julia Extension,\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, ensure you followed the instructions for setting up Julia {ref}`on your local computer <jl_jupyterlocal>`.\n",
    "2. In particular, ensure you did the initial [VS Code setup](initial_vscode_setup)\n",
    "3. Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for your platform and open it\n",
    "\n",
    "See the [Julia VS Code Documentation](https://www.julia-vscode.org/docs/dev/gettingstarted/#Installation-and-Configuration-1) for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have done a typical Julia installation, then this may be all that is needed and no configuration may be necessary.  However, if you have installed Julia in a non-standard location you may need to manually set the executable path.

    "```{tip} \"Open in Code\" on MacOS and Linux\n",
    "VS Code supports the \"Open with Code\" action in File Explorer if chosen during the installation.  This is convenient, but not necessary.  To support it on MacOS you need to install a [Automator script or separate package](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64040393/open-a-folder-in-vscode-through-finder-in-macos).  Similarly, see [here](https://github.com/vvanloc/Nautilus-OpenInVSCode) for support on linux.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Executing Files\n",
    "\n",
    "First we will reorganize our file so that it is a set of functions with a call at the end rather than a script.  Replace the code with\n",

    "\n",
    "# execute main function\n",
    "plot_results()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "While it is fine to use scripts with code not organized in functions for exploration, you will want to organize any serious computations inside of a function.  While this may not matter for every problem, this will let the compiler avoid global variables and highly optimize the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "The behavior of global variables accessed in loops in the `REPL`, Debugger, inline code evaluations, and Jupyter notebooks is different from executed files.  See the documentation on [soft scoping](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/variables-and-scoping/#On-Soft-Scope) for more background.  A good heuristic which will avoid these issues is to (1) never use loops outside of a function when you write `.jl` files; and (2) if you ever use the `global` keyword, assume something is wrong and you should put something in a function.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can execute a `.jl` file in several ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within a terminal, you can provide the path to the file.  For example,\n",

    "### Using the Debugger\n",
    "\n",
    "To debug your function, first click to the left of a line of code to create a breakpoint (seen as a red dot).\n",

    ":width: 100%\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then choose the `Run and Debug` option and it will execute `plot_results()` at the bottom of the file, and then stop inside at the breakpoint. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Some users may see other options like `Run active Julia file` instead of `Run and Debug` in the run and debug tab. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As an alternative way to start the debugger, you can instead debug a call within the REPL with commands like `@run plot_results()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "The Julia Debugger runs some of the code in an interpreted mode that might be far slower than typical  compiled and optimized code.  For this reason, it may not be possible to use it in all the same ways you might use something like the Matlab debugger.  However, if you organize your code appropriately, you may find that the [compile mode](https://www.julia-vscode.org/docs/stable/userguide/debugging/#Compile-mode-1) enables you to concentrate on debugging only some of the functions, while letting slow functions remain compiled.\n",

    "## The REPL\n",
    "Even if you are working primarily in `.jl` and/or Jupyter Notebooks in Julia, you will need to become comfortable with the REPL.  We saw some initial use of this when [adding packages](adding_packages) and exploring the code above, but the REPL has many [more features](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/#The-Julia-REPL).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Starting a REPL\n",
    "There are several ways to start the REPL.\n",
    "- Within VS Code, executing code inline will start it as required.\n",
    "- In the command palette of VS Code, choose  `> Julia: Start REPL`\n",
    "- Outside of VS Code, if julia was installed on your system path, you can simply type `julia` or with other options\n",
    "\n",
    "The command line options for starting Julia are set to decent defaults for terminals running within VS Code, but you will want to set them yourself if starting the REPL otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, the argument `--threads` determines the number of threads that Julia starts with.  If starting `julia` on the command line without specifying any arguments, it will default to 1 (or check an environment variable).  To have Julia automatically choose the number of threads based on the number of processors for your machine, pass the `--threads auto` argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "VS Code sets the number of threads automatically based on the number of cores on your machine, but the value can be modified in its `> Preferences: Open User Settings` and then search for `Julia: Num Threads`.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important choice is the `--project` toggle which determines whether you want to activate an existing project (or create a new one) when starting the interpreter.  Since a key feature of Julia is to have fully reproducible environments, you will want to do this whenever possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "To emphasize this point, this is an example of the `]st ` showing the global environment has only the bare minimum of packages installed.  With this workflow, all other packages are installed only when a given project is activated.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "A key difference between Julia and some other package managers is that it is capable of having different versions of each package for different projects - which ensures all projects are fully reproducible by you, your future self, and any other collaborators.  While there is a global set of packages available (e.g. `IJulia.jl` to ensure Jupyter support) you should try to keep the packages in different projects separated.  See the documentation on [environments](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/code-loading/#Environments-1) and the [package manager](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/getting-started/) for more.\n",

    "To see this in action, within an external terminal we will open it using both methods, and then use `] st` to see which project is activated and which packages are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, with `julia --threads auto` we see that the globally installed packages are available at first, but that the existing `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` in that folder are chosen after we choose `] activate .`\n",

    "\n",
    "As discussed, the Julia package manager allowed you to create fully reproducible environments (in the same spirit as Python's and Conda virtual environments).\n",

    "As we saw before, `]` brings you into package mode.  Some of the key choices are\n",
    "\n",
    "* `] instantiate` (or `using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()` in the normal julia mode) will check if you have all of the packages and versions mentioned in the `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` files, and install as required.\n",
    "  - This feature will let you reproduce the entire environment and, if a `Manifest.toml` is available, the exact package versions used for a project.  For example, these lecture notes use [Project.toml](https://github.com/QuantEcon/lecture-julia.notebooks/blob/main/Project.toml) and [Manifest.toml](https://github.com/QuantEcon/lecture-julia.notebooks/blob/main/Manifest.toml) - which you likely instantiated during installation after downloading these notebooks.\n",
    "* `] add Distributions` will add a package (here, `Distributions.jl`) to the activated project file (or the global environment if none is activated).\n",
    "* Likewise, `] rm Distributions` will remove that package.\n",
    "* `] st` will show you a snapshot of what you have installed.\n",
    "* `] up` will upgrade versions of your packages to the latest versions possible given the graph of compatibility used in each.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "On some operating systems (such as OSX) REPL pasting may not work for package mode, and you will need to access it in the standard way (i.e., hit `]` first and then run your commands).\n",

    "\n",
    "While not required for these lectures, consider installing the following extensions.  As before, you can search for them on the Marketplace or choose `Install` from the webpages themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter): VS Code increasingly supports Jupyter notebooks directly, and this extension provides the ability to open and edit `.ipynb` notebook files without installing Conda and running `jupyter lab`.\n",
    "2. [GitHub Pull Requests and Issues](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github): while VS Code supports the git {doc}`version control <../software_engineering/version_control>` natively, these extension provides additional features for working with repositories on GitHub itself.\n",
    "3. [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot): AI-assisted code completion.  See [GitHub Education Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) for free access if you are a student or educator.\n",
    "4. [OpenAI Codex](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=openai.chatgpt): official ChatGPT-powered coding agent for VS Code.  Works best if you already have ChatGPT Plus/Pro (or higher) and provides Copilot-like chat, edits, and inline help inside the editor.\n",
    "5. [Claude Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=anthropic.claude-code): Anthropic's agentic coding tool that can edit files, run commands, and search your codebase.  Available as a VS Code extension.  See the [Claude Code documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) for setup and usage.\n",

    "## Using LLMs with VS Code\n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub Copilot, Google Gemini Code Assist, OpenAI Codex, and Claude Code can provide completions, refactors, and documentation suggestions directly in VS Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "For consistent answers across a project you can add short \"instructions\" files that the assistants read to understand your style and constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **GitHub Copilot**: Place `.github/copilot-instructions.md` in the repo root to define project-wide guidance (file name and location are fixed; see the [Copilot docs](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/customizing-copilot/adding-custom-instructions-for-github-copilot)). You can also create a personal `global-copilot-instructions.md` in your user settings directory if you want defaults across repos.\n",
    "- **Google Gemini**:\n",
    "  - **VS Code**: Install the [Gemini Code Assist](https://cloud.google.com/code/docs/vscode/install) extension (part of Google Cloud Code). While Gemini does not yet auto-ingest a hidden config file, the convention is to place a `GEMINI.md` in your repo root and explicitly reference it (e.g., keep it open or `@mention` it) at the start of a session.\n",
    "  - **CLI**: You can use the [Google Cloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/gemini) (`gcloud gemini ...`) for pipe-based operations, or use the API directly. For repo-chat on the command line, many use community tools (like `llm` or `aider`) configured with a Gemini API key.\n",
    "- **OpenAI Codex**: Codex looks for `AGENTS.md` (or `AGENTS.override.md`) starting from your repo root and up to the current directory, plus a global copy at `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` (Codex home defaults to `~/.codex`, but you can point `CODEX_HOME` elsewhere if you want it under `~/.openai`). You can add other fallback names—such as `instructions.md` at the repo root—via `project_doc_fallback_filenames` in `~/.codex/config.toml`. See the [AGENTS.md guide](https://developers.openai.com/codex/guides/agents-md) for details.\n",
    "- **Claude Code**: Place a `CLAUDE.md` file in your repo root to provide project-specific instructions.  Claude Code automatically reads this file at the start of each session.  You can also create a personal `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` for global defaults across all projects, and folder-level `CLAUDE.md` files for directory-specific guidance.  Beyond instructions, Claude Code supports \"skills\"—custom slash commands (e.g., `/commit`, `/review-pr`) that you define in `~/.claude/commands/` or `.claude/commands/` within a project. See the [Claude Code memory documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/memory) for details on `CLAUDE.md` and the [slash commands guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/slash-commands) for creating custom skills.\n",

    "- Follow the SciML style guide where applicable: [https://docs.sciml.ai/SciMLStyle/stable/](https://docs.sciml.ai/SciMLStyle/stable/).\n",
    "- Use snake_case for files, functions, and variables; 4-space indent; concise comments.\n",
    "- Prefer pure functions and keep logic inside modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tests\n",
    "- Always add or update unit tests with code changes.\n",
    "- Recommend `julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.test()'` before claiming completion; if tests are slow, state what would be run.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Structure\n",
    "- Keep the existing layout:\n",
    "  - /src for package code\n",
    "  - /test for tests\n",
    "  - Project.toml and Manifest.toml tracked and updated only as needed\n",
    "- Avoid adding new top-level folders unless requested.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Safety\n",
    "- Avoid destructive git commands; prefer minimal diffs (apply_patch) and cite file paths/lines.\n",

    "### Sharing Instructions Across Tools with Symlinks\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid maintaining duplicate content across multiple instruction files, you can create one canonical file and use symbolic links for the others.  For example, using `AGENTS.md` as the primary file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} bash\n",
    "# Create symlinks (macOS/Linux)\n",
    "ln -s AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md\n",
    "ln -s AGENTS.md GEMINI.md\n",
    "mkdir -p .github && ln -s ../AGENTS.md .github/copilot-instructions.md\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With this setup, you only edit `AGENTS.md` and all other tools read the same content through their symlinks.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "**Windows users**: Symlinks require extra setup.  Enable Developer Mode (Settings → Privacy & security → For developers → toggle \"Developer Mode\" on), then configure Git with `git config --global core.symlinks true`.  You must clone the repository fresh after enabling these settings for symlinks to work correctly.\n",

    "### Using Claude for Code Review with GitHub Actions\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond using LLMs inside your editor, you can integrate Claude directly into your GitHub workflow so that it automatically reviews pull requests, responds to questions in issues, and even implements changes — all triggered by mentioning `@claude` in a comment.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is powered by [Claude Code GitHub Actions](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action), an official GitHub Action maintained by Anthropic.  Once installed, any collaborator can tag `@claude` in a PR comment or issue and receive an AI-powered response that follows your project's `CLAUDE.md` guidelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Quick Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "The fastest way to set up the action is from the Claude Code CLI:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} bash\n",
    "claude            # start Claude Code\n",
    "/install-github-app   # guided installer\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command walks you through installing the [Claude GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/claude), adding your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` as a repository secret, and creating the workflow file.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "You must be a **repository admin** to install the GitHub app and add secrets.  The app requests read & write permissions for Contents, Issues, and Pull requests.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Manual Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "If you prefer to configure things yourself:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install the Claude GitHub app at [github.com/apps/claude](https://github.com/apps/claude) and grant it access to your repository.\n",
    "2. Add your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to the repository secrets (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions).\n",
    "3. Create a workflow file at `.github/workflows/claude.yml`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} yaml\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Automated Review on Every PR\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also configure Claude to review every pull request automatically, without needing an `@claude` mention:\n",
