    "\n",
    "Before we solve the model, let's make some quick calculations that\n",
    "provide intuition on what the solution should look like.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, observe that the worker has two instruments to build\n",
    "capital and hence wages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. invest in capital specific to the current job via $\\phi$\n",
    "1. search for a new job with better job-specific capital match via $s$\n",

    "\n",
    "Our risk neutral worker should focus on whatever instrument has the highest expected return.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relative expected return will depend on $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose first that $x = 0.05$\n",
    "\n",
    "* If $s=1$ and $\\phi = 0$, then since $G(x,\\phi) = 0$,\n",
    "  taking expectations of {eq}`jd` gives expected next period capital equal to $\\pi(s) \\mathbb{E} U\n",
    "  = \\mathbb{E} U = 0.5$.\n",
    "* If $s=0$ and $\\phi=1$, then next period capital is $G(x, \\phi) = G(0.05, 1) \\approx 0.23$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both rates of return are good, but the return from search is better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next suppose that $x = 0.4$\n",
    "\n",
    "* If $s=1$ and $\\phi = 0$, then expected next period capital is again $0.5$\n",
    "* If $s=0$ and $\\phi = 1$, then $G(x, \\phi) = G(0.4, 1) \\approx 0.8$\n",
    "\n",
    "Return from investment via $\\phi$ dominates expected return from search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining these observations gives us two informal predictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. At any given state $x$, the two controls $\\phi$ and $s$ will function primarily as substitutes --- worker will focus on whichever instrument has the higher expected return.\n",
    "1. For sufficiently small $x$, search will be preferable to investment in job-specific human capital.  For larger $x$, the reverse will be true.\n",
