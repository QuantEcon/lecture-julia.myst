    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The McCall search model {cite}`McCall1970` helped transform economists' way of thinking about labor markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "To clarify vague notions such as \"involuntary\" unemployment, McCall modeled the decision problem of unemployed agents directly, in terms of factors such as\n",
    "\n",
    "* current and likely future wages\n",
    "* impatience\n",
    "* unemployment compensation\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the decision problem he used dynamic programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we set up McCall's model and adopt the same solution method.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we'll see, McCall's model is not only interesting in its own right but also an excellent vehicle for learning dynamic programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The McCall Model\n",
    "\n",
    "```{index} single: Models; McCall\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "An unemployed worker receives in each period a job offer at wage $W_t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "At time $t$, our worker has two choices:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Accept the offer and work permanently at constant wage $W_t$.\n",
    "1. Reject the offer, receive unemployment compensation $c$, and reconsider next period.\n",
    "\n",
    "The wage sequence $\\{W_t\\}$ is assumed to be iid with probability mass function $p_1, \\ldots, p_n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $p_i$ is the probability of observing wage offer $W_t = w_i$ in the set $w_1, \\ldots, w_n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The worker is infinitely lived and aims to maximize the expected discounted sum of earnings.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{E} \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\beta^t Y_t\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The constant $\\beta$ lies in $(0, 1)$ and is called a **discount factor**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The smaller is $\\beta$, the more the worker discounts future utility relative to current utility.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable  $Y_t$ is income, equal to\n",
    "\n",
    "* his wage $W_t$ when employed\n",
    "* unemployment compensation $c$ when unemployed\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Trade Off\n",
    "\n",
    "The worker faces a trade-off:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Waiting too long for a good offer is costly, since the future is discounted.\n",
    "* Accepting too early is costly, since better offers might arrive in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "To decide optimally in the face of this trade off, we use dynamic programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic programming can be thought of as a two step procedure that\n",
    "\n",
    "1. first assigns values to \"states\" and\n",
    "1. then deduces optimal actions given those values\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll go through these steps in turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Value Function\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to optimally trade off current and future rewards, we need to think about two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. the current payoffs we get from different choices\n",
    "1. the different states that those choices will lead to next period (in this case, either employment or unemployment)\n",
    "\n",
    "To weigh these two aspects of the decision problem, we need to assign *values* to states.\n",
    "\n",
    "To this end, let $V(w)$ be the total lifetime *value* accruing to an unemployed worker who enters the current period unemployed but with wage offer $w$ in hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "More precisely, $V(w)$ denotes the value of the objective function {eq}`objective` when an agent in this situation makes *optimal* decisions now and at all future points in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course $V(w)$ is not trivial to calculate because we don't yet know what decisions are optimal and what aren't!\n",
    "\n",
    "But think of $V$ as a function that assigns to each possible wage $w$ the maximal lifetime value that can be obtained with that offer in hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "A crucial observation is that this function $V$ must satisfy the recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: odu_pv\n",
    "\n",
    "V(w)\n",
    "= \\max \\left\\{\n",
    "        \\frac{w}{1 - \\beta}, \\, c + \\beta \\sum_{i=1}^n V(w_i) p_i\n",
    "    \\right\\}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "for every possible $w_i$  in $w_1, \\ldots, w_n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This important equation is a version of the **Bellman equation**, which is\n",
    "ubiquitous in economic dynamics and other fields involving planning over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition behind it is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* the first term inside the max operation is the lifetime payoff from accepting current offer $w$, since\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "w + \\beta w + \\beta^2 w + \\cdots = \\frac{w}{1 - \\beta}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* the second term inside the max operation is the **continuation value**, which is the lifetime payoff from rejecting the current offer and then behaving optimally in all subsequent periods\n",
    "\n",
    "If we optimize and pick the best of these two options, we obtain maximal lifetime value from today, given current offer $w$.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this is precisely $V(w)$, which is the l.h.s. of {eq}`odu_pv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Optimal Policy\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose for now that we are able to solve {eq}`odu_pv` for the unknown\n",
    "function $V$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have this function in hand we can behave optimally (i.e., make the\n",
    "right choice between accept and reject).\n",
    "\n",
    "All we have to do is select the maximal choice on the r.h.s. of {eq}`odu_pv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal action is best thought of as a **policy**, which is, in general, a map from\n",
    "states to actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, the state is the current wage offer $w$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given *any* $w$, we can read off the corresponding best choice (accept or\n",
    "reject) by picking the max on the r.h.s. of {eq}`odu_pv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we have a map from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\{0, 1\\}$, with 1 meaning accept and zero meaning reject.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can write the policy as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sigma(w) := \\mathbf{1}\n",
    "    \\left\\{\n",
    "        \\frac{w}{1 - \\beta} \\geq c + \\beta \\sum_{i=1}^n V(w_i) p_i\n",
    "    \\right\\}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $\\mathbf{1}\\{ P \\} = 1$ if statement $P$ is true and equals zero otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also write this as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sigma(w) := \\mathbf{1} \\{ w \\geq \\bar w \\}\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $\\bar w$ is a constant depending on $\\beta, c$ and the wage distribution, called the *reservation wage*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent should accept if and only if the current wage offer exceeds the reservation wage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, we can compute this reservation wage if we can compute the value function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Computing the Optimal Policy: Take 1\n",
    "\n",
    "To put the above ideas into action, we need to compute the value function at\n",
    "points $w_1, \\ldots, w_n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In doing so, we can identify these values with the vector $v = (v_i)$ where $v_i := V(w_i)$.\n",

    "It turns out that there is exactly one vector $v := (v_i)_{i=1}^n$ in\n",
    "$\\mathbb R^n$ that satisfies this equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "To compute this vector, we proceed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: pick an arbitrary initial guess $v \\in \\mathbb R^n$.\n",

    "\\quad\n",
    "\\text{for } i = 1, \\ldots, n\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: calculate a measure of the deviation between $v$ and $v'$, such as $\\max_i |v_i - v_i'|$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4: if the deviation is larger than some fixed tolerance, set $v = v'$ and go to step 2, else continue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 5: return $v$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm returns an arbitrarily good approximation to the true solution\n",
    "to {eq}`odu_pv2`, which represents the value function.\n",
    "\n",

    "satisfied by $T$ as a self-mapping on $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "One implication is that $T$ has a unique fixed point in $\\mathbb R^n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, it's immediate from the definition of $T$ that this fixed\n",
