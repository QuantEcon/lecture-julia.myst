    "\n",
    "He fears that outcomes will actually be determined by another model that he cannot describe explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "All that he knows is that the actual data-generating model is in some (uncountable) set of models that surrounds his approximating model.\n",
    "\n",
    "He quantifies the discrepancy between his approximating model and the genuine data-generating model by using a quantity called *entropy*.\n",
