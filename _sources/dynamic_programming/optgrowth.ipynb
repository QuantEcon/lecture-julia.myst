    "Consider an agent who owns an amount $y_t \\in \\mathbb R_+ := [0, \\infty)$ of a consumption good at time $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This output can either be consumed or invested.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the good is invested it is transformed one-for-one into capital.\n",

    "The resulting capital stock, denoted here by $k_{t+1}$, will then be used for production.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to think about solving this problem is to look for the best **policy function**.\n",

    "A policy function is a map from past and present observables into current action.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be particularly interested in **Markov policies**, which are maps from the current state $y_t$ into a current action $c_t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For dynamic programming problems such as this one (in fact for any [Markov decision process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process)), the optimal policy is always a Markov policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the current state $y_t$ provides a sufficient statistic\n",
    "for the history in terms of making an optimal decision today.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is quite intuitive but if you wish you can find proofs in texts such as {cite}`StokeyLucas1989` (section 4.1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Hereafter we focus on finding the best Markov policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our context, a Markov policy is a function $\\sigma \\colon\n",

    "The value function gives the maximal value that can be obtained from state $y$, after considering all feasible policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "A policy $\\sigma \\in \\Sigma$ is called **optimal** if it attains the supremum in {eq}`vfcsdp0` for all $y \\in \\mathbb R_+$.\n",

    "### The Bellman Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "With our assumptions on utility and production function, the value function as defined in {eq}`vfcsdp0` also satisfies a **Bellman equation**.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Bellman equation is important because it gives us more information about the value function.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also suggests a way of computing the value function, which we discuss below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Greedy policies\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary importance of the value function is that we can use it to compute optimal policies.\n",

    "> *A feasible consumption  policy is optimal if and only if it is* $v^*$-*greedy*\n",

    "The intuition is similar to the intuition for the Bellman equation, which was\n",

    "\n",
    "See, for example, theorem 10.1.11 of [EDTC](http://johnstachurski.net/edtc.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, once we have a good approximation to $v^*$, we can compute the (approximately) optimal policy by computing the corresponding greedy policy.\n",
