    "**Unlike other lectures, this focuses on performance rather than simple clarity.**\n",

    "## The Bang-Bang Pattern for Generic Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The best coding strategy for numerical algorithms depends on the size of the problem. Different array types and mutation patterns are appropriate at different scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "For large vectors and matrices, allocation of intermediate arrays can be a major bottleneck. In these cases, we want to write **in-place code** that mutates pre-allocated buffers to achieve zero allocations and maximum performance -- see {ref}`in-place-functions` for background. Writing zero-allocation code is also essential in practice for compatibility with Enzyme.\n",
    "\n",
    "For small fixed-size problems, `StaticArrays` (stack-allocated, no heap) can be dramatically faster than standard `Vector`/`Matrix`. The [rule of thumb](https://juliaarrays.github.io/StaticArrays.jl/stable/) is that StaticArrays are beneficial when the **total number of elements** is under about 100 -- so an `SVector{10}` or an `SMatrix{3,3}` are good candidates, while an `SMatrix{20,20}` (400 elements) is not. The biggest wins (10x--100x) come at very small sizes (under ~20 elements); beyond 100 elements, compilation costs explode and the stack/register advantages disappear.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge is that these two approaches seem incompatible: standard in-place operations (`mul!`, `ldiv!`, `copyto!`) only work with mutable arrays, while StaticArrays are immutable and require returning new values. Ideally, we want to write a **single algorithm** that works with both array types -- choosing the optimal strategy for each problem size without duplicating code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `!!` Convention\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach is a pattern called the \"bang-bang\" convention.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function `f!!` **always returns its result** and **tries to mutate in-place when possible**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It checks if a type can be modified directly with `ismutable(Y)` and then modifies in place if possible.  For example, if mutable it might call `mul!(Y, A, B)` and return `Y`; if immutable it would simply return `A * B`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes the natural data structure **arrays of arrays** (e.g., `Vector{SVector{N}}`) rather than 2D matrices, since each element can be either mutable or immutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key `!!` Utilities\n",
    "\n",
    "| Function | Mutable path | Immutable path | Use case |\n",
    "|----------|-------------|----------------|----------|\n",
    "| `mul!!(Y, A, B)` | `mul!(Y,A,B); return Y` | `return A*B` | Matrix/vector multiply |\n",
    "| `mul!!(Y, A, B, α, β)` | `mul!(Y,A,B,α,β); return Y` | `return α*(A*B) + β*Y` | Accumulate: `Y = αAB + βY` |\n",
    "| `muladd!!(Y, A, B)` | `mul!(Y,A,B,1.0,1.0); return Y` | `return Y + A*B` | `Y += A*B` |\n",
    "| `copyto!!(Y, X)` | `copyto!(Y,X); return Y` | `return X` | Copy data |\n",
    "| `assign!!(Y, X)` | loop `Y[i]=X[i]; return Y` | `return X` | Enzyme-safe copy (avoids `Base.copyto!`) |"

    "\n",
    "When writing generic code, we often need to allocate workspace arrays that match the type family of the inputs -- mutable `Vector`/`Matrix` or immutable `SVector`/`SMatrix`. Rather than maintaining separate allocation functions for each case, we use **prototype-based allocation**: pass an existing array as a template, and `alloc_like` creates a new zeroed array of the same type. The `SVector`/`SMatrix` overloads are necessary because Julia's `similar` returns a mutable `MVector`/`MMatrix` for static arrays, which would lose immutability and stack allocation."
