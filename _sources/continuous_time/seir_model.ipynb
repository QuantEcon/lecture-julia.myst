    "## The SEIR Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In the version of the SEIR model, all individuals in the population are assumed to be in a finite number of states.\n",
    "\n",
    "The states are: susceptible (S), exposed (E), infected (I) and removed (R).\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of [compartmentalized model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology#Elaborations_on_the_basic_SIR_model)  has many extensions (e.g. SEIRS relaxes lifetime immunity and allow transitions from $R \\to S$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Comments:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Those in state R have been infected and either recovered or died.  Note that in some variations, R may refer only to recovered agents.\n",
    "* Those who have recovered, and live, are assumed to have acquired immunity.\n",
    "* Those in the exposed group are not yet infectious.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Changes in the Infected State\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the SEIR model, the flow across states follows the path $S \\to E \\to I \\to R$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will ignore birth and non-covid death during our time horizon, and assume a large, constant, number of individuals of size $N$ throughout.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this, the symbols $S, E, I, R$ are used for the total number of individuals in each state at each point in time, and $S(t) + E(t) + I(t) + R(t) = N$ for all $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we have  assumed that $N$ is large, we can use a continuum approximation for the number of individuals in each state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transitions between those states are governed by the following rates\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\beta(t)$ is called the *transmission rate* or *effective contact rate* (the rate at which individuals bump into others and expose them to the virus).\n",
    "* $\\sigma$ is called the *infection rate* (the rate at which those who are exposed become infected)\n",
    "* $\\gamma$ is called the *recovery rate* (the rate at which infected people recover or die)\n",
    "\n",
    "The rate $\\beta(t)$ is influenced by both the characteristics of the disease (e.g. the type and length of prolonged contact required for a transmission) and behavior of the individuals (e.g. social distancing, hygiene).\n",
    "\n",
    "The SEIR model can then be written as\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: seir_system_big\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "     \\frac{d S}{d t}  & = - \\beta \\, S \\,  \\frac{I}{N}\n",
    "     \\\\\n",
    "     \\frac{d E}{d t}   & = \\beta \\, S \\,   \\frac{I}{N}  - \\sigma E\n",
    "     \\\\\n",
    "      \\frac{d I}{d t}  & = \\sigma  E  - \\gamma I\n",
    "     \\\\\n",
    "      \\frac{d R}{d t}  & = \\gamma  I\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $dy/dt$ represents the time derivative for the particular variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first term of {eq}`seir_system_big`, $-\\beta \\, S \\,  \\frac{I}{N}$, is the flow of individuals moving from $S \\to E$, and highlights the underlying dynamics of the epidemic\n",
    "\n",
    "* Individuals in the susceptible state (S) have a rate $\\beta(t)$ of prolonged contacts with other individuals where transmission would occur if either was infected\n",
    "* Of these contacts, a fraction $\\frac{I(t)}{N}$ will be with infected agents (since we assumed that exposed individuals are not yet infectious)\n",
    "* Finally, there are $S(t)$ susceptible individuals.\n",
    "* The sign indicates that the product of those terms is the outflow from the $S$ state, and an inflow to the $E$ state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Reproduction Number\n",
    "\n",
    "If $\\beta$ was constant, then we could define $R_0 := \\beta / \\gamma$.  This is the famous *basic reproduction number* for the SEIR model.  See {cite}`heffernan2005perspectives` for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the transmission rate is time-varying, we will follow notation in {cite}`NBERw27128` and refer to $R_0(t)$ as a time-varying version of the basic reproduction number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyzing the system in {eq}`seir_system_big` provides some intuition on the $R_0(t) := \\beta(t) / \\gamma$ expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Individual transitions from the infected to removed state occur at a Poisson rate $\\gamma$, the expected time in the infected state is $1/\\gamma$\n",
    "* Prolonged interactions occur at rate $\\beta$, so a new individual entering the infected state will potentially transmit the virus to an average of $R_0 = \\beta \\times 1 / \\gamma$ others\n",
    "* In more complicated models, see {cite}`heffernan2005perspectives` for a formal definition for arbitrary models, and an analysis on the role of $R_0 < 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the notation $R_0$ is standard in the epidemiology literature - though confusing, since $R_0$ is unrelated to $R$, the symbol that represents the removed state.  For the remainder of the lecture, we will avoid using $R$ for removed state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to solving the model directly, we make a few changes to {eq}`seir_system_big`\n",
    "\n",
    "* Re-parameterize using $\\beta(t) = \\gamma R_0(t)$\n",
    "* Define the proportion of individuals in each state as $s := S/N$ etc.\n",
    "* Divide each equation in {eq}`seir_system_big` by $N$, and write the system of ODEs in terms of the proportions\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: seir_system\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "     \\frac{d s}{d t}  & = - \\gamma \\, R_0 \\, s \\,  i\n",
    "     \\\\\n",

    "\n",
    "Since the states form a partition, we could reconstruct the \"removed\" fraction of the population as $r = 1 - s - e - i$.  However, keeping it in the system will make plotting more convenient.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by implementing a simple version of this model with a constant $R_0$ and some baseline parameter values (which we discuss later).\n",

    "While maintaining the core system of ODEs in $(s, e, i, r)$, we will extend the basic model to enable some policy experiments and calculations of aggregate values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extending the Model\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we can consider some additional calculations such as the cumulative caseload (i.e., all those who have or have had the infection) as $c = i + r$.  Differentiating that expression and substituting from the time-derivatives of $i(t)$ and $r(t)$ yields $\\frac{d c}{d t} = \\sigma e$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will assume that the transmission rate follows a process with a reversion to a value $\\bar{R}_0(t)$ which could conceivably be influenced by policy.  The intuition is that even if the targeted $\\bar{R}_0(t)$ was changed through social distancing/etc., lags in behavior and implementation would smooth out the transition, where $\\eta$ governs the speed of $R_0(t)$ moves towards $\\bar{R}_0(t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: Rode\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\\frac{d R_0}{d t} &= \\eta (\\bar{R}_0 - R_0)\\\\\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, let $\\delta$ be the mortality rate, which we will leave constant.  The cumulative deaths can be integrated through the flow $\\gamma i$ entering the \"Removed\" state.\n",

    "Define the cumulative number of deaths as $D(t)$ with the proportion $d(t) := D(t)/N$.\n",

    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "While we could integrate the deaths given the solution to the model ex-post, it is more convenient to use the integrator built into the ODE solver.  That is, we add $\\frac{d}{dt} d(t)$ rather than calculating $d(t) = \\int_0^t \\delta \\gamma\\, i(\\tau) d \\tau$ ex-post.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a common trick when solving systems of ODEs.  While equivalent in principle to using the appropriate quadrature scheme, this becomes especially convenient when adaptive time-stepping algorithms are used to solve the ODEs (i.e. there is not a regular time grid). Note that when doing so, $d(0) = \\int_0^0 \\delta \\gamma i(\\tau) d \\tau = 0$ is the initial condition.\n",
