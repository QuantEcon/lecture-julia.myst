    "\n",
    "To begin, observe that the worker has two instruments to build\n",
    "capital and hence wages:\n",

    "1. invest in capital specific to the current job via $ \\phi $  \n",
    "1. search for a new job with better job-specific capital match via $ s $  \n",

    "\n",
    "Our risk neutral worker should focus on whatever instrument has the highest expected return.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relative expected return will depend on $ x $.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose first that $ x = 0.05 $\n",
    "\n",
    "- If $ s=1 $ and $ \\phi = 0 $, then since $ G(x,\\phi) = 0 $,\n",
    "  taking expectations of [(33.1)](#equation-jd) gives expected next period capital equal to $ \\pi(s) \\mathbb{E} U\n",
    "  = \\mathbb{E} U = 0.5 $.  \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Both rates of return are good, but the return from search is better.\n",

    "Return from investment via $ \\phi $ dominates expected return from search.\n",

    "Combining these observations gives us two informal predictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. At any given state $ x $, the two controls $ \\phi $ and $ s $ will function primarily as substitutes — worker will focus on whichever instrument has the higher expected return.  \n",
