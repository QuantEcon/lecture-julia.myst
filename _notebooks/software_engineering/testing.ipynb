    "This lecture discusses structuring a project as a Julia module, and testing it with tools from GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Specifying dependencies (and their versions) so that your project works across Julia setups and over time.  \n",
    "- Being able to load your project’s functions from outside without copy/pasting.  \n",
    "- Writing tests that run locally, *and automatically on the GitHub server*.  \n",
    "- Having GitHub test your project across operating systems, Julia versions, etc.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Throughout this lecture, important points and sequential workflow steps are listed as bullets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this style of coding is to ensure that [test driven development](#test-driven) is possible, which will help ensure that your research is reproducible by yourself, your future self, and others - while avoiding accidental mistakes that can silently break old code and change results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, it makes collaboration on code much more feasible - allowing individuals to work on different parts of the code without fear of breaking others’ work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, since many economics projects occur over multiple years - this will help your future self to reproduce your results and make changes without remembering all of the subtle tricks required to get things operational."

    "## Introduction and Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of the software engineering and continuous integration (CI) will be done through [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).\n",
    "\n",
    "The GitHub actions execute as isolated and fully reproducible environments on the cloud (using containers), and are initiated through various actions on the GitHub repo.  In particular, these are typically initiated through:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Making commits on the main branch of a repository.  \n",
    "- Creating a PR on a repository, or pushing commits to it.  \n",
    "- [Tagging a release](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository) of a repository, which provides a snapshot at a particular commit.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For publicly available repositories, GitHub provides free minutes for executing these actions, whereas there are limits on the execution time for private repositories - though signing up for the GitHub academic plans previously discussed (i.e, the [Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack/) or [Academic/Researcher plans](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-education-for-educators-and-researchers/)) provides additional free minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "While you may think of a ‘’Package’’ as a shared and maintained set of reusable code, with Julia it will turn out to be the most useful way to organize personal and private projects or the code associated with a particular paper.  The primary benefit of using a package workflow is **reproducibility** for yourself, your future self, and collaborators.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you will find the testing workflow as an essential element of working on even individual projects, since it will prevent you from making accidental breaking changes at points in the future - or when you come back to the code after several years.\n",
