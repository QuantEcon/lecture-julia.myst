    "- automating standard tasks (e.g., memory management)  \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Low level languages* aim for speed and control, which they achieve by\n",
    "\n",
    "- being closer to the metal (direct access to CPU, memory, etc.)  \n",
    "- requiring a relatively large amount of information from the user (e.g., all data types must be specified)  \n",

    "\n",
