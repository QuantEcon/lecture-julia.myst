    "\n",
    "In an earlier lecture [Linear Quadratic Dynamic Programming Problems](https://julia.quantecon.org/../dynamic_programming/lqcontrol.html) we have studied how to solve a special\n",
    "class of dynamic optimization and prediction problems by applying the method of dynamic programming. In this class of problems\n",
    "\n",
    "- the objective function is **quadratic** in **states** and **controls**  \n",
    "- the one-step transition function is **linear**  \n",
    "- shocks are i.i.d. Gaussian or martingale differences  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture and a companion lecture [Classical Filtering with Linear Algebra](https://julia.quantecon.org/classical_filtering.html), we study the classical theory of linear-quadratic (LQ) optimal control problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The classical approach does not use the two closely related methods – dynamic programming and  Kalman filtering – that we describe in other lectures, namely, [Linear Quadratic Dynamic Programming Problems](https://julia.quantecon.org/../dynamic_programming/lqcontrol.html) and [A First Look at the Kalman Filter](https://julia.quantecon.org/../tools_and_techniques/kalman.html).\n",

    "- $ z $-transform and lag operator methods, or.  \n",
    "- matrix decompositions applied to linear systems of first-order conditions for optimum problems.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture and the sequel [Classical Filtering with Linear Algebra](https://julia.quantecon.org/classical_filtering.html), we mostly rely on  elementary linear algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main tool from linear algebra we’ll put to work here is [LU decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LU_decomposition).\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll begin with discrete horizon problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we’ll view infinite horizon problems as appropriate limits of these finite horizon problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later, we will examine the close connection between LQ control and least squares prediction and filtering problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "These classes of problems are connected in the sense that to solve each, essentially the same mathematics is used."
