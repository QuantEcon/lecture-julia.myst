    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Many problems in macroeconomics involve simulating dynamic models — whether to explore quantitative counterfactuals and perform numerical experiments (e.g., impulse response and conditional moments) or to estimate structural parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically these models are either analyzed as linearized systems, where derivatives and equations for estimation are available in closed form, or simulated as a black box with derivative-free optimizers used to calibrate and estimate parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lecture shows a third path: using automatic differentiation (AD) to differentiate the entire simulation, enabling counterfactual experiments and estimation with gradient-based methods (e.g., optimization or gradient-based samplers such as [Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_Monte_Carlo)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Building on the **linear state space** models from [linear models](https://julia.quantecon.org/../introduction_dynamics/linear_models.html) and the [kalman filter](https://julia.quantecon.org/../introduction_dynamics/kalman.html), we use [Enzyme.jl](https://enzyme.mit.edu/julia/stable/) to differentiate simulations end-to-end. See [auto-differentiation](https://julia.quantecon.org/../more_julia/auto_differentiation.html) for background on in-place patterns and Enzyme wrappers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along the way, you will learn practical patterns for high-performance differentiable code:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Writing **allocation-free, in-place simulations** that AD can differentiate — a pattern that also provides maximum performance for many non-differentiable use cases  \n",
    "- Choosing between **forward mode** (efficient for impulse responses and few-parameter sensitivities) and **reverse mode** (efficient for gradients of all structural model parameters with scalar objectives like loss functions)  \n",
    "- Using **batch tangents** to compute multiple derivatives in a single pass  \n",
    "- **Verifying correctness** with type-stability checks (`@inferred`), allocation profiling (`@btime`), and finite-difference testing (`EnzymeTestUtils`) — essential in practice for any high-performance code  \n",
    "- **Calibrating economic models** by plugging AD gradients into optimization routines (e.g., L-BFGS via `Optimization.jl`)  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These techniques extend naturally to richer settings — nonlinear dynamics, heterogeneous agent models, and full structural estimation — wherever you need fast, exact gradients of simulated outcomes with respect to parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Caution**: The code in this lecture is significantly more advanced than some of the other lectures, and requires some experience with both auto-differentiation concepts and a more detailed understanding of type-safety and memory management in Julia.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enzyme.jl is under active development and while state-of-the-art, it is often bleeding-edge. Some of the patterns shown here may change in future releases. See [auto-differentiation](https://julia.quantecon.org/../more_julia/auto_differentiation.html) for the latest best practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, you may find using an LLM valuable for navigating the perplexing error messages of Enzyme.jl. Compilation times can be very slow, and performance intuition is not always straightforward."
