    "\n",
    "Stepping back, there are three ways to calculate the gradient or Jacobian\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analytic derivatives / Symbolic differentiation  \n",
    "  - You can sometimes calculate the derivative on pen-and-paper, and potentially simplify the expression.  \n",
    "  - In effect, repeated applications of the chain rule, product rule, etc.  \n",
    "  - It is sometimes the most accurate and fastest option if there are algebraic simplifications.  \n",
    "  - Sometimes, symbolic computation on the computer is a good solution if the package can handle your functions. Doing algebra by hand is tedious and error-prone, but sometimes invaluable.  \n",
    "- Finite differences  \n",
    "  - Evaluate the function at least $ N+1 $ times to get the gradient – Jacobians are even worse.  \n",
    "  - Large $ \\Delta $ is numerically stable but inaccurate; too small is numerically unstable but more accurate.  \n",
    "  - Choosing the $ \\Delta $ is hard, so use packages such as [DiffEqDiffTools.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DiffEqDiffTools.jl).  \n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Automatic Differentiation  \n",
    "  - The same as analytic/symbolic differentiation, but where the **chain rule** is calculated **numerically** rather than symbolically.  \n",
    "  - Just as with analytic derivatives, can establish rules for the derivatives of individual functions (e.g. $ d\\left(sin(x)\\right) $ to $ cos(x) dx $) for intrinsic derivatives.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "AD has two basic approaches, which are variations on the order of evaluating the chain rule: reverse and forward mode (although mixed mode is possible).\n",

    "1. If a function is $ R \\to R^N $, then **forward-mode** AD can find the jacobian in $ O(1) $ sweeps.  \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Are you differentiating with respect to this argument?**  \n",
    "  - **No:** Use `Const(x)`. This tells Enzyme the value is constant and its derivative is zero.  \n",
    "  - **Yes (Scalar):** Use `Active(x)`. Enzyme will return the derivative directly.  \n",
    "  - **Yes (Array/Struct):** Use `Duplicated(x, dx)`. You must provide the shadow memory `dx`.  \n",
    "1. **Is the argument mutated (written to) inside the function?**  \n",
    "  - **Yes, and I need to know the value:** Use `Duplicated(x, dx)`. Enzyme needs the shadow `dx` to store intermediate adjoints during the reverse pass.  \n",
    "  - **Yes, and I do not need to access the value:** You could still use `Duplicated(x, dx)` or `DuplicatedNoNeed(x, dx)` which may avoid some calculations required to calculate `x` if you are not using it directly.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
