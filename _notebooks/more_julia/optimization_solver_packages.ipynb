    "\n",
    "The promise of differentiable programming is that we can move towards taking the derivatives of almost arbitrarily\n",
    "complicated computer programs, rather than simply thinking about the derivatives of mathematical functions.  Differentiable\n",
    "programming is the natural evolution of automatic differentiation (AD, sometimes called algorithmic differentiation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Stepping back, there are three ways to calculate the gradient or Jacobian\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analytic derivatives / Symbolic differentiation  \n",
    "  - You can sometimes calculate the derivative on pen-and-paper, and potentially simplify the expression.  \n",
    "  - In effect, repeated applications of the chain rule, product rule, etc.  \n",
    "  - It is sometimes, though not always, the most accurate and fastest option if there are algebraic simplifications.  \n",
    "  - Sometimes symbolic integration on the computer a good solution, if the package can handle your functions. Doing algebra by hand is tedious and error-prone, but\n",
    "    is sometimes invaluable.  \n",
    "- Finite differences  \n",
    "  - Evaluate the function at least $ N+1 $ times to get the gradient – Jacobians are even worse.  \n",
    "  - Large $ \\Delta $ is numerically stable but inaccurate, too small of $ \\Delta $ is numerically unstable but more accurate.  \n",
    "  - Choosing the $ \\Delta $ is hard, so use packages such as [DiffEqDiffTools.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DiffEqDiffTools.jl).  \n",
    "  - If a function is $ R^N \\to R $ for a large $ N $, this requires $ O(N) $ function evaluations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\partial_{x_i}f(x_1,\\ldots x_N) \\approx \\frac{f(x_1,\\ldots x_i + \\Delta,\\ldots x_N) - f(x_1,\\ldots x_i,\\ldots x_N)}{\\Delta}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Automatic Differentiation  \n",
    "  - The same as analytic/symbolic differentiation, but where the **chain rule** is calculated **numerically** rather than symbolically.  \n",
    "  - Just as with analytic derivatives, can establish rules for the derivatives of individual functions (e.g. $ d\\left(sin(x)\\right) $ to $ cos(x) dx $) for intrinsic derivatives.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "AD has two basic approaches, which are variations on the order of evaluating the chain rule: reverse and forward mode (although mixed mode is possible).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If a function is $ R^N \\to R $, then **reverse-mode** AD can find the gradient in $ O(1) $ sweep (where a “sweep” is $ O(1) $ function evaluations).  \n",
    "1. If a function is $ R \\to R^N $, then **forward-mode** AD can find the jacobian in $ O(1) $ sweeps.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explore two types of automatic differentiation in Julia (and discuss a few packages which implement them).  For both, remember the [chain rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule)\n",
