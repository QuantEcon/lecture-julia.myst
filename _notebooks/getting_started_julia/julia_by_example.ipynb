    "### (Optional) Resources for Introductory Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "If Julia is your first programming language, then you may want to examine other resources before proceeding through these chapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you will want to ensure that you have [installed Conda](https://julia.quantecon.org/getting_started.html#install-jupyter), [Julia](https://julia.quantecon.org/getting_started.html#intro-repl) in the previous section, and are able to [launch Jupyter Lab](https://julia.quantecon.org/getting_started.html#running-jupyterlab).  Then, even without downloading these lecture notes you can start learning Julia.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some resources for users with little to no programming experience are the:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Introduction to Julia](https://juliaacademy.com/p/intro-to-julia) which is appropriate for those with little programming experience.  \n",
    "  - You will need to sign up for this course to access it, but it is free.  \n",
    "  - Avoid the initial lecture on the installation of Julia and nteract.  \n",
    "  - The Jupyter Notebooks for this class are available [online](https://github.com/JuliaAcademy/Introduction-to-Julia)  \n",
    "1. [Julia for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhQ2JMBcfAsi_3g2AFJ6B84d8c5jw5kXp) from the [julia for talented amateurs](https://www.youtube.com/c/juliafortalentedamateurs) channel.  \n",
    "  - If you watch these, ignore the environment.  It is using a different open-source editor (i.e. Atom, which is being slowly phased out) and the REPL.  However the content itself is independent of the environment. Skip any setup instructions and just use Jupyter.  \n",
    "1. [Julia Programming for Nervous Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP8iPy9hna6Qpx0MgGyElJ5qFlaIXYf1R) youtube tutorials.  \n",
    "  - These get advanced fairly quickly, but have plenty of great content.  \n",
    "  - This may be less gentle of an introduction for new users given the tooling choices.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you have even introductory experience with any programming language (e.g. you do not need to review what a loop, array, variable, or conditional “if” statement is), you should be able to start directly with these lectures."

    "  - As a reminder, the `]` enters the package mode, and with some terminals you can directly copy in the whole `] add MyPackage` string.  \n",
    "1. using a directory with a `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` files, which provides an isolated set of packages for a particular project.  \n",
    "  - If you load a jupyter notebook, it will automatically look up the tree for the project files to activate, but will not automatically install them.  This can be done with `] instantiate`, as we did in our [installation](https://julia.quantecon.org/getting_started.html#install-packages)  \n",
    "  - The project files can be in parent folders relative to the notebooks and sourcecode.  \n",
